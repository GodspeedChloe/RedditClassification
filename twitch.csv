1,So Ive been streaming around 2 months got to about 100 followers well 150 but 50 of those are by one troll And have been really enjoying streaming to my small audience   I dont really play many scary games and one night some one bought me Five nights at freddys and I screamed like a little girl From then on I learned my followers enjoyed how much I hate horror games so every Friday Ive done Frightday and played scary games I stream MonWedFri but Fridays are always when I pull in most people So Ive made sure Ive always got a good scary game ready  I then started to play outlast 2 and had many jump scares that was clipped but one of them was perfect  My partner went to the shop and got me a Jack Daniels in a can and sent me 2 year old daughter up the stairs to give it to me My office is in the loft Due to my headphones I never heard her enter the room At this point a crow jumped up in the game and made me scream I then looked down to see a devil child looking back at me and screamed blue murder  This was the clip: https:clipstwitchtvStylishScrumptiousBobaTheTarFu  The clip was posted to reddit and started to get some serious views At one point I was on target to be most watched video of the day I then topped that and became the most watched of the week then the month and finally of all time  Ive had ladbible youtubers etc all contact me to use my clips I even had family members contact me saying WTF are you doing on my social feed this morning  My channel jump to a 1000 followers and last night was my first stream since this all happened I managed to pull in 80 views and it was an amazing experience  At the moment Im so overwhelmed by the response and happy to see people enjoying me being a pussy ;  At this point I dont think I want my channel to grow much larger as Ive always enjoyed talking to my viewers and I think if I got any more the chat would move to fast for both me and them to enjoy  But anyway thats my story of going from zero to number 1 spot in 24 hours
2,Im not going try and spearhead this as some kind of righteous cause because I just dont know enough about the situation but I think it is something worthy of discussion  What exactly does Twitch base its video game banlist guidelines upon?  A games actual content or its perceived first appearance?  If people are unaware of what Im talking about there was a recent video submission via the video game developer Yandere Dev in which he discusses his games initial ban on twitch and his following experiences trying to start a discourse through official channels to find answers to rectify the issue  Im not going to link to the submission itself because that seems to be against the rules in this sub but if youre interested in the topic feel free to googleyoutube or search reddit for the overall discussion  There seems to be a great deal of subjective and bias selection going on within what is appropriate on twitch and what isnt I could be entirely wrong but the fact that this is someones passion project and lively hood that a great number of people are interested in that is being ignored on one of the Internets largest viewing platforms to this day is fairly baffling
3,They are playing you for your money  Their nice looks and kind words after a donation are just to get you to donate more  Donating money will not help you get closer to these women and start a relationship with them If anything they will honestly just think of you as a sad lonely person who doesnt know how to go out and meet real people Which if you donate to a female streamer FOR THIS REASON you areunfortunate truth I say For this reason because there are MANY female streamers that DONT do this They deserve every penny they make  But that doesnt mean you cant turn it around Go out for a walk in the park hit up the library hell just walk around downtown You will have the opportunity to talk to many women who are much more down to Earth and not out just to get your money like some of these Twitch females are  One in particular I will not name namesyou already know who it is has been found out to be married even though she lies to her viewers and says shes single She says shes single because she wants to give you hope that there is a chance you will be with her someday Its all part of their plan to get you to donate money to them And youre falling for it IMO its okay for someone to hide their personal life but the second you LIE to your viewers the people supporting you about it? Thats wrong  Stop it  Stop  Dont be a part of the problem Be a part of the solution  EDIT: I want to make sure everyone knows I am ONLY talking about streamers that literally do exactly this I am NOT talking about streamers that DONT do this MORE streamers than not DONT do this and props to them for being chill and down to Earth There are only a select few women who take advantage of their viewers Im just trying to inform those of you who donate to them that its never going to happen
4,According to the Twitch employee reviews from glassdoor which [you can read here]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsTwitchReviewsE639426htm?sortsortType=RDsortascending=falsefilteremploymentStatus=REGULARfilteremploymentStatus=PART_TIMEfilteremploymentStatus=UNKNOWN you need to be signed into glassdoor to view the actual reviews Twitch is currently not in a good state behind the scenes The ratings for the company have just nosedived from where they were in late 2016 of last year During late 2016 the company had a 45 star rating ~85 of employees would recommend working there to a friend ~95 of employees approved of the ceo ~85 of employees had a positive business outlook for the company Currently Twitch is sitting at 29 stars 43 would recommend working there to a friend 44 of employees approve of the CEO and 37 of employees have a positive business outlook for the company So why is this? Well after looking through some reviews written by Twitch employees here are some common themes:   By all accounts the Twitch CEO is terrible at managing his company [One reviewer thinks Emmett seems to only care about managing his projects and ideas rather than the needs and ideas of his employees]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17215978htm Another reviewer states Twitch employees [openly mock the CEO for his incompetence]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17824973htm Another reviewer notes that at many of their product reviews Emmett apparently [screams at his employees]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsTwitchReviewsE639426_P4htm?sortsortType=RDsortascending=false And almost every review I read negatively criticizes the CEO in some way That doesnt sound like good management to me  Many employees noted the lack of a clear and coherent vision for the future One reviewer stated that one week Emmett told his team to build something and completely forgot about it stating [Emmett has the classic new CEO quirk of being easily swayed by the last enthusiastic person who speaks to him]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsTwitchReviewsE639426_P4htm?sortsortType=RDsortascending=false Another reviewer noted that the company is suffering from [NotInventedHere syndrome]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17824973htm NotInventedHere syndrome from what I can tell  is the rash need by programmers to reinvent the wheel every time they want to change their code [\Source\] https:wwwdevelopercomdesignarticlephp3338791OvercomingquotNotInventedHerequotSyndromehtm If programmers and coders are suffering from NIHS lots of money and time is being wasted coding things that dont need to be coded which is likely a sign of poor management One other reviewer states that [Everyone works in their own silo and if something goes wrong theres a lot of finger pointing and it was hisher stupid idea It makes people question whether or not they even know what theyre doing]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17328257htm The reviewer then goes on to blame the Chief of StaffProgram director hes not sure what her job title is saying most of the Twitch staff have no idea what she does Other Twitch employees have told the reviewer that she apparently acts belligerently and makes ridiculous requests for other employees and gets away with it because shes Emmetts right hand This doesnt sound like a fun company to code for  Several people noted that Amazons culture and Twitchs culture are actively damaging one another One reviewer says [half the employees in Twitch report to Twitchs CEO and the other half report to Amazons special CEO]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17988901htm They also say that the two halves pretend to work together but function more like separate entities hence the silo comparison they make Another reviewer notes that Amazon [apparently has separate guidelines]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17328257htm not sure if these are work guidelines to those of Twitch and theyre incompatible and they need to be integrated properly Several people have stated in the reviews Ive cited they would much prefer to just have the Amazon CEO run things by himself rather than have 2 separate CEOs with different ideas about what Twitchs future should look like  A number of Twitch employees both current and former have regretted joining or staying with the company To illustrate this point here are some the titles of recent glassdoor reviews: Feel free to read some of these by the way  1 [Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW18011438htm  2 [New hire package now includes pitchfork]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17988901htm  3 [Ship good work then get out]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17979443htm  4 [Total shshow  stay far away]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17953058htm  5 [Worst Mistake of My Career Dont Let It Be Yours]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17739928htm  6 [Started 5 Months Ago Already Jumping Ship]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17351364htm  7 [Zero leadership whole company in dumpster fire stay away]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17231889htm  8 [Stay away come back when the dust clears IF the dust clears]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17215978htm  9 [Going bad quickly]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17817810htm  10 [In decline]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17258277htm  11 [The great company that fell apart as it scaled]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17214575htm   Yeah its not a good time to be hired by Twitch   According to one review Twitch is telling its [employees in HR to write glassdoor reviews that are positive in an attempt to hide the negative reviews]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17231889htm I was skeptical at first about this being true but then I read the positive reviews and some of them look suspicious Examples:  1  [Decline to comment]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17362748htm This review when read sounds pretty negative but the review score is still positive somehow This was likely done as an attempt to appease HRmanagement Also the title says Decline to comment yet the review is pretty damn descriptive  2 [Travail parfait]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17239924htm This review was written in French No Im not joking Curious why Twitch would apparently hire and fly someone to their HQ who cant speak any English Ironically enough I suspect this was written by someone who cant speak any French  3 [Great company]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW15992506htm The review reads: Pros: Free food great people nice place; Cons: Company long hours but they cool Thats an actual review someone wrote Okay wheres the details? What kind of food? What kind of people? Why was the place nice? What kind of hours were you working? You see they read like reviews that someone wrote not because they wanted to but because they were told to and didnt want to or were in a rush to write [There]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW14975239htm [are]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW14845841htm [several]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW16481936htm [like]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17348223htm [this]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW16685588htm If you do a side by side comparison of the positive and negative reviews youll notice a severe lack of detail in the positive reviews which likely indicates theyre manipulating review scores Those numbers I gave at the start of this article are much higher than what they should be  So if you dont think things are going well as a Twitch streamer or viewer youre not alone  Some other sidenotes:    Free food flexible work schedules unlimited vacation with managerial approval and free massages are offered to all employees which is nice  Apparently they pay some employees with Amazon stock  Emmett apparently not only serves as [the CEO but also the CTO CPO and CIO]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17938881htm which might explain why management is so dysfunctional  A company email went around where a curseword was used This makes me think a lot of the reviews that mention this are legit  [The Engineering team at Twitch apparently looks more like a gladiator arena than an actual team \lots of infighting and politics\]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17988901htm  [The DevOps and systems teams are apparently skeletal]https:wwwglassdoorcomReviewsEmployeeReviewTwitchRVW17824973htm  Several employees are worried about the lack of promotions and career growth if they choose to stay employed  TL;DR  Twitch is currently a pair of silos built on a house of playing cards and its only a matter of time before it collapses unless someone fixes it  all edits I made are grammatical in nature
5,I dont want to be the barer of bad news but I came across this post from [rBATProject]https:wwwredditcomrBATProject which was posted by  [uAuGKlasD]https:wwwredditcomuserAuGKlasD  I cant find anyone that has mentioned this email on this subbreddit yet so I thought I should let people know:  >Dear Creators   >   >By the end of 2018 a new proposal to a European Union Directive might pass that could limit you from sharing content and earning a livelihoodnot just on Twitch but on the internet at large Its called Article 13 and even if this is your first time hearing about it its not too late to do something   >   >You and your communities have worked hard to build this incredible place and its worth protecting The fallout from Article 13 isnt limited to creators in the European Union Everyone stands to lose if content coming out of and going into the region is throttled So were writing to all of youevery creator on Twitchto make sure youre informed about whats happening If you share our concerns about Article 13 were also including a list of ways you can help us fight against it We know amazing things are possible when Twitch bands together A little bit more of that magic right now could go a long way   >   >Whats happened so far?

6,I understand that its Bethesda and they get special treatment But streaming in Talk shows with nothing more than a Please stand by message for 10 hours certainly qualifies as unattended content and seems a bit excessive I was hyped at first but at this point its just annoying and for any other average streamer would clearly be breaking the rules
7,Are you serious about these ads every 5 minutes ???? This is unwatchable holy moly  edit: ~~2~~ ~~3~~ ??? ad breaks since this post  edit2: LOL ad > ending > ad  edit3: Rip inbox I guess this blew up because they are replaying the first set of episodes like 3 times so every timezone can watch the AD marathon with Yugioh breaks and complain about it Also: Thanks for the gold kind stranger :\^

9,I had an individual come into my chat and stay all 4 hours They talked and seemed to really enjoy my stream even during the banter between my friends yelling For that person to come and stay when my channel normally has 12 viewers max makes me extremely happy and is what makes me want to persue this as a dream of mine So for those who seek out small streamer who stay and chat who give small streamers a chance thank you so much Keep being amazing  Edit: This got a lot of traction and I want to say thank you all Most of you here comented genuine and nice things I also gained some support at twitch so thank you for that also I hope you all have a great day

11,You could even place one in every different game I know there are people out there that like checking out streams with little to no viewcount and this could also eliminate the hassle of endless scrolling to find one 
12,Im sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but I thought you guys would know best  My boyfriend really enjoys streaming on twitch and to be honest Im completely new to the concept With Christmas coming up I was wondering if there was anything I could get him to show my support Ive already subscribed to his channel with my prime account but I was wondering if theres anything else? I know next to nothing besides how to watch his streams I dont know if he has to pay to have an account if theres anything to boost his viewers something like that? Even hardware suggestions would be great He did make a comment about needing a better audio set up if he wanted to stop relying on his roommates but again I dont really know where to begin  Again Im sorry if this is the wrong place I just really want to show him I support his hobby and would appreciate any suggestions  Update:Thank you to everyone for all the suggestions so far I really appreciate you all taking the time to help me come up with ideas and also explaining things to me Im going to look into the mics people suggested the stream deck a green screen and clothinggetting his logo onto a shirt or hoodie I think   Last Update: Again thank you to everyone who took the time to answer This has given me a lot of ideas for the future as well Special thanks to uduckforceone for going on the sly and messaging my boyfriend about his set up He fou d out the next upgrade he wants is a green screen so Im going to go with that Youre all amazing
13,site not working at all
14,This would be great:  I ban a troll he gets no notification and if he is writing something noone will read it in chat expect himself So the troll thinks that noone is reacting gets bored and leave and the regular viewers are not affected  Would be better then force trolls to create new accounts and keep trolling  Thanks you  Edit: This option should NOT replace the original ban There should be an option to choose Normal Ban or Silent ban  Edit2: Wow Almost 500 Upvotes already oO  Edit3: Its over 1000
15, 10 Donts on Twitch  Here are some common mistakes which happen on Twitch These are based on several opinions so dont necessarily take these as facts Its your stream and you decide what you want to do with it  but here are some things you should avoid to improve the overall quality of your channel  1 Dont over complicate your layout   > We get it you have access to some cool tools to display information about all kinds of different things or you are or know a fantastic graphic designer and made a beautiful HUD However should you use it? Not necessarily its okay to display some kind of relevant information but keep it minimal Remember people come to watch the game  so let them watch it without too many things in the way  2 Dont use too many Twitch Extensions  > These handy little tools on your profile are just too convenient right? And dont forget all those little games We know but keep them to a minimum However fun and useful they can be they are also a distraction from the stream  3 Dont use too many Twitch Bots  > Nightbot Moobot and many others are packed with features and commands You can even customize most of it but dont overload them with useless commands or timers Keep the commands brief and add cooldowns so that they cant be spammed The goal is to have an engaging conversation with your chat At this moment you cant really talk to robots but who knows when that might change?  4 Dont use cheap audio equipment  > Audio is one of the most important aspects of your stream if not _the_ most important Triple check your audio quality Make sure you have a decent microphone and rewatch your stream often to check if your audio is alright If you cant bare it others cant either Make sure your audio is synced properly and try to reduce background noise as much as possible We have written a guide on our wiki about this topic which you can check out [here]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchwikibasicaudio  5 Dont call out lurkers  > After a long day at workschool we want to relax and check out a few streams here and there We arent always interested in a conversation with the streamer and if we are you will know You might have fancy tools to detect viewers joining your stream but dont call them out unless they want to be called out  6 Dont complain about X  > Of course you might be in the top 1 of that game but that doesnt mean others do Dont be too hard on your team Be a good sport; you will earn much more respect that way  7 Dont ask for donationstips  > We wish we didnt need to mention this but we see it happen still way too often Never ask for donations Displaying a fancy donation goal is fine If you happen to do a charity stream feel free to ask for donations and let your viewers know the cause  8 Dont stream when you are in a bad mood  > Chats spidey senses can tell when you are in a bad mood You cant really hide it If you dont feel like streaming just dont Take the day off and relax or do something fun  9 Dont expect chat to do the talking for you  > You need to talk first to get the chat talking too You cant just stay quiet and expect the chat to be active Even if you dont have any viewerschatters try to entertain like they are there You will gain overall experience on how to engage with Twitch chat  A random lurker might be watching you when you dont realise it  who knows?  10 Dont talk about your channel on other streams  > Never advertise your channel on other streams as this will only give you bad publicity Even subtle messages like I have to go now preparing for my stream or I am going live in a moment should be avoided You can talk about your channel if the streamer asks for it    If you have anything to add feel free to leave it in the comments 
16,I used to love to go through the different categories and look at random channels I tried it the other day and it was one ad after the other on every single new channel some of these channels had less than 100 viewers I kinda wonder if its hurting those smaller channels even more since people are less likely to now click on smaller channels knowing theres an unskiooable ad  Maybe its just me but I dont think this is the right solution You should at least be able to watch the first few minutes and then maybe roll an ad Instead this is discouraging people from discovering new channels 
17,Im posting this from a throw away for obvious reasons mainly because I dont want to be known as That twitch guy who told people to give up because my normal reddit and twitch user name are the same  But something I see on here is never give up or keep going Which is ok to say but to follow through with it is another story  Im gonna use a friend of mine who had been streaming since 2013 So close to 5 years I dont know when exactly he started beyond 2013  He never got more than 5 viewers unless I hosted him or he was streaming a new release   He wanted more he kept going based on posts on here His entitlement so to speak grew to the point where he was getting pissed at new streamers who in his mind should wait their turn to be at the top get ahead of him   He followed all the advice on here cam always talking panels filled out social media discord ect He never saw naturally above 5 viewers   It got to the point where it consumed him He lost his job dropped out of college because he thought he could make a living off twitch he thought he could be part of that crowd  Well here we are in 2018 He is now living with me trying to get his life back together He is working a minimum wage fast food job because thats the only place that would hire him He cant afford to go back to college or even a trade school He would have been homeless had I not stepped in and offered him a place to stay   So people who are struggling for viewers who think you can make it big While there is that slim 1 chance of it happening Dont let it consume you  It is ok to give up It is ok to just stop Dont let twitch take your life over dont pile so much effort and passion into something that in the end most likely wont work out the way you want it to  Please for your mental sake and personal sake just give up if you feel like you are going no one Sure 1  3 viewers seems to be like a milestone here but it isnt worth stopping your life for to focus on   This is probably gonna get downvoted into oblivion since this reddit seems to be the happy go lucky you can do it type where anything negative is frowned on but it has to be said These people who say dont give up very likely have never streamed before or are the ones who are the few who succeed and can afford to stream to live  Hell Ive been partnered for 3 years make a decent wage off bits subs and ads but there is no way in hell I could afford to quit my real job not yet at least I dont even live in a state where CoL is high in fact I think Im in one of the lower ones Id have to check that later on but still even here where shit is cheap going full time and just dropping my real job wouldnt be financially feasible or responsible
18,Ive been using Twitch for 9 years now and have experienced the website before the inception of ads and after they were added  Despite the community outrages and adblock usage option back then I didnt block these ads at first they werent intrusive or annoying There were also a larger variety of video ads that played But then you guys started to play the same fucking ads over and over  I understand that the ads that get played are random but it also seemed like you removed over half of the ads from your pool So as a result I enabled the adblocker up until the inception of the Prime deal with no ads because hey I figured I might as well help support the website that has provided me countless hours of entertainment  But now here we are with the ads being back on the site for Prime users The ads themselves arent an issue the issue is that you literally have three or four ads that constantly get played and often multiple times at once  If youre going to force ads on everyone do it in a way that wont drive everyone crazy

20,CW: The following post contains content about suicide attempts and self harm  EDIT: TL;DR the post and comments: The suggestions are for Twitch to reexamine it policies and ToS; have people with a background in health to advise them not turn it into a mental health service replacement; reexamine its bot functions that may harm people at risk; and include features that the community can alert to help people who are at risk of self harm and suicide and not ban them  Hello  I am a moderator of an Australian streamers Twitch channel  I am also a health professional and hold a mental health first aid certificate Last night Viewer made some statements in chat that he was having a rough day and he might as well do an IRL stream and shoot himself in the head or hang himself Chat sent him well wishes the streamer was also concerned and I jumped into whisper with Viewer  After only moments of conversation with Viewer it was evident that he was seriously suicidal and had self harmed within the past two days I stayed with him on chat and found out he lives on the other side of the world to me and noone to contact urgently where he was He was alone and he was desperate and in danger I used the Report: Self Harm function an noted this person needed urgent medical attention I continued to stay with him in whisper and the situation was beginning to improve Within 5 minutes there was a response from Twitch but not what I was expecting  Twitch banned his account  I managed to make contact with Viewer via Instagram and continued to improve his state over the next hour made a plan to make contact again and for him to link back in with his health professional  I am absolutely infuriated at the lack of response and heavy handed approach Twitch has taken If there was a person sitting on the other end of my Report function I am dismayed and disgusted that they would sit there and ban a user when someone has requested urgent medical attention  If it this is a botban hammer I am even more disgusted that Twitch would use an automated feature to deal with vulnerable people who are at immediate risk of ending their lives To use an automated feature is even more unacceptable and deplorable  I have used their Help function and Twitter with no response in over 12 hours Absolutely shameful; this is bigger than trolls we are talking about the biggest killers of youth today Self harm can be an indicator of suicide and when somebody states they are thinking about suicide it is important to help them Not silence them  Other big websites like Facebook have tools to step in and help after a Self Harm report has been made and I am so angry that Twitchs response is to put self harm and suicide in the too hard basket and ban users instead  Step up your game Twitch and I am not going to shut the fuck up about this until something reasonable has been done to change this in the future
21,Hope everyone is safe  Someone shot at Docs home and hit his house
22,Nice guys what a sickening platform
23,If i go to IRL like 80 in there is ASMR its super annoing becose you cant finde any other chanels any more
24,Twitch is one of the biggest entertainment gates on the internet and is a way for video gamers to entertain others show off games great and small and even brings communities together  This is all under threat from the looming Comcast 1TB cap rolling out    [You can read about it here]https:wwwengadgetcom20161006comcasts1tbdatacapsstarttorolloutnationwide    [Here is the Comcast FAQ about the cap]https:dataplanxfinitycomfaq    How does this affect everyone on Twitch?    Any variety Twitch streamer needs to download video games and most of us download them through popular platforms such as Steam the Playstation or XBox stores and other platforms Many of these video games are not small This will eat up a chunk of your cap     Partnered streamers can and usually do stream at a higher bitrate Pair this with the video game downloads and youre seeing a larger chunk of your cap being eaten up     Viewers who watch streams that broadcast at a high bitrate will also see their chunk eaten If you do anything else like Netflix Youtube or Hulu any pairing of these with Twitch can leave very little breathing room    But I can get the cap turned off for 50 a month    No one should have to worry about paying for a cap and many cant     This is a legacy mechanism resurrected to allow Comcast to rake in more money There have been releases from Comcast [admitting that there was no congestion or utilization issues that justified this cap]http:wwwextremetechcomcomputing212376comcastadmitsthatitsdatacapsareabusinessdecisionnotanengineeringrequirement   So what do I do?    [Write a complaint to the FCC]https:consumercomplaintsfccgovhcenus If you stream have this link posted by your chat bot every so often so your viewers can complain too This affects everybody Even if you dont believe you would be affected by this you can still write in on behalf of those who are No one stands to gain except Comcast and everyone stands to lose We must act to ensure we keep our internet free and our Twitch awesome    Is there anything else I can do?    Write to [your Senators]http:wwwsenategovgeneralcontact_informationsenators_cfmcfm?OrderBy=state and [your Representatives]http:wwwhousegovrepresentativesfind for them to apply pressure to the FCC board and ask them to help push through legislation that classifies internet as a public utility    Of all the communities on the internet we can help ensure a better internet for everyone regardless of whether theyre involved with Twitch and we can ensure our community is able to push forward with awesomeness If youve written the FCC your Representative and your Senator tell us in the comments
25,Its so obnoxious Every time I find a blind run of a game I think Im gonna have a fun time watching them struggle then succeed but theres almost always the added challenge of a speed runner in chat with their notsohumble brag: I speed run this game This part isnt that hard In fact its pretty easy Really the entire game is pretty easy Sometimes its not as obviously patronizing as that but chat and streamer both know what youre doing Please why do people do this shit?
26,Today was the day that I received my first donation after streaming for a little over a month everyday I had actually just setup my donations today since I never really wanted to have a donation link when I was barely starting out since I wanted to focus more on improving before I had one Anyway I was playing some smite and talking to chat when I got my donation it was by a regular viewer who comes through everyday and hangs out When I first saw the alert it was instant joy I felt some kind of way that was just euphoric Just to know that someone out there actually enjoys my content so much that they would spend time and  money on it knowing they could have spent that dollar on anything else but they chose me made me feel super special and made me think that I am going to keep growing the nice feedback felt even better than the donation Sorry if this is just some long nonsense I just felt like sharing how I felt :   Edit: Thank you for all of the motivation and nice comments it really means a lot to me I cant express that enough If anyone would like to come and stop by youre more than welcome to talk and hang out Everyone is friendly and chill and we would love to see you all there Much love from your truly  
27,He just jumped on for a couple minutes admitted to mistakes and said hes taking time off to focus on his family Sad to hear this :  https:wwwtwitchtvvideos209596628?t=107s
28,Really good thinking twitch should probably have tought it trough and tried something els no one even asked for the twitch prime loot and now you are crying over that you give away stuff for 100 when literally no one asked for it and from what i have read everyone want 0 ads insted
29,There are representatives in the US government who think giving internet service providers the power to choose what information news and websites you can see is ok and that charging you twice as much for a Facebook package is good for the economy It would destroy the internet as we know it and youre the only thing that can stop them  wwwbattleforthenetcom
30,Let me introduce myself I am the twitch streamer Hanjarolol I am a father to 2 beautiful girls and a husband to an amazing wife and this is my story that im hoping gets noticed I felt I needed to plead my case to the world at this point   Over the last 4 and a half years I have put in 1014 hours a day 67 days a week for a solid 2 years I did not take days off to develop my stream to the point of an average of about 150 concurrent viewers This is where my issues began In the fall of 2017 I moved with my family to southwest Missouri after looking long and hard for a house near my wifes family but also with stable cable internet I found a house in a suburb of Springfield Missouri It was perfect for my family After our move I got everything setup and ready to stream exhausting 2000 mile drive but I made it After a few months of stable connectivity I began noticing some upstream issues and started running daily speedtests to find out what was happening   At first glance being on a residential plan I assumed perhaps I had hit my data limit of 2 TB a month However this was not the case After getting multiple techs out to my home and replacing modems all lines from my tap to my home I still had issues with my internet My upstream would not go above 12 mbs and these were not solid speeds because I was stuck streaming at less than 400 bitrate400kbs at 480p and still losing about 30 of my frames These issues started in late November of 2017 and and are still occurring as we speak I have had countless contacts with the Technical Operations Supervisor and have more than 10 tech visits to my home to try to pinpoint a problem that I KNOW is on their main line between my tap and their amplifier to my areaI know this because they ran a power line from their van to my modem plugged my modem directly into the drop line to my tap and the speeds were still bad   In the 6 months this has been occurring I have watched my stream fall from 150 viewer average to about a 15 viewer average losing thousands upon thousands of dollars in income and  well over 10000 hours of invested time creating my stream all while this company does nothing to help me I feel very victimized by my ISP and there are no alternatives in this area other than att adsl 101 or satellite Can we get this noticed and make it go big so we can get some eyes from Mediacom Corporate Headquarters? I am out of options at this point for streaming and am hoping for some sort of notice so we can actually get some resolve I appreciate your time guys Thanks for reading my story   tl:dr Spent 4 years developing stream to fulltime income worthy state lose all viewers due to no longer being able to stream a decent quality without massive drops due to ISP not fixing problems on their end in a timely manner  update: It is fixed An amplifier on the next street over was causing feedback onto my line and they finally found the issue
31,This makes it IMPOSSIBLE to moderate large channels For christs sake please pause the chat when I scroll up if I need to time out or ban anyone I cant click on any names when the chat is fast
32,I cant bare to watch another minute of someone staring down their phone to read chat while theyre driving  Ill leave it at that this time

34,The new site is just awful I cant even click out of the Top Cheer menu It feels like no thought was put into it at all   So many poorly optimized things so user unfriendly  Just give us the option I dont see the need to screw over people who dont like the new Streamlined version of the website that is just awful 
35,I know getting the rights to do this kinda thing might not be easy or even possible but I feel like it would be a great gesture
36,Im tired of only seeing fortnite streamed and featured on twitch We need variety again
37,Nothing is loading   Lmao: https:twittercomDrDisRespectstatus960590589757550592
38,So I did an IRL on Thursday and about 10 mins into the stream I got a wave of racist antiAfrican American comments and follows from people with racist usernames Me being the positive person I am I decide to ignore it ban who i needed to and keep streaming More time passes and they posted my home address in chat and in my discord chat Immediately I deleted it hid the messages and turned off my onscreen chat and notifications I set my chat to followers only 1 month for the time being to weed them out and continued to stream and talk with my friends in the stream All the while i guess the trolls are still going on  About 10 mins later I get about 3 different pizza place deliveries to my front door I let the drivers know yea Im a youtuber cause most didnt know what Twitch was lol and someones trying to prank me they were mostly understanding and were like oooh ok well well let our managers know whats going on  I notified my local law enforcement to let them know what was going on in case they tried to SWAT afterwards and they let me know ok we have it on record  After another 30 mins or so i finished up my stream cause by that time only one or 2 people were still in chat and at that point I was just drained  The aftermath   The next morning I put in a large number of requests to public record sites to remove my information most did within a few minutes If you have a unique name I highly recommend googling your name and seeing what pops up  Filed a formal report with my local police department I also learned that I have some of the most chillest officers in my town and gave them my business card with my twitch info on there one was even an anime fan too So they are aware that I am a streamer  I shut down all open instant invites to my Discord Channel weeded out the trolls as well and made it into an invitesubpatron only server  Reported the spam accounts to Twitch still no word on that as they are still active as of today  I WILL still stream despite all of this  Has anything like this happened to you as a streamer? Do you think I handled the situation ok? Were there things you wouldve done differently? Let me know in the comments below  Update:   The Spam accounts were removed from Twitch thanks for that  My info has been removed from a vast majority of the public record sites and google searches  This article has helped immensely: [https:wwwcomparitechcomblogvpnprivacywhatisdoxxinghowtoavoid]https:wwwcomparitechcomblogvpnprivacywhatisdoxxinghowtoavoid  No other incidents have happened since ive streamed thank you all so much for the support and information It goes to show what a wonderful community Twitch has You all are awesome
39,Everytime I boot up my stream I just get racist trolls  Im a black streamer so I think you can guess some of the things they say Just a bunch of racist kids trying to ruin my day Every single time i press the stream button  I try to be such a happy smiling and positive streamer all the time I just want to make people laugh  A few of my stream regulars come and thats nice But it just sucks how Im getting more trolls and racists by the day If I was growing my viewernumbers it would be fine But Im still getting the same 510 viewers and moredifferent racist trolls everyday I get so excited when I see a new face but then it turns out that they are just another troll  I know that as Twitch streamers we need to harden our shell But Im at my tipping point People are ruining what I love to do Its making me depressed  Can anybody offer me some advice on how to defend my stream and chat? I know I need to appoint more active moderators But is there any programs or tools I can use to make sure certain wordsphrases arent said in chat? Any chatbots? Is there a way to stop trolls from making accounts and spamming racial slurs at me?  Im just so sick of it I dont know why people are still racist Why do people love to ruin other peoples day?  Thanks for reading my little rantcry for help lol  UPDATE: jesus christ i did not expect all of you to see this THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR ADVICE KIND WORDS AND SUPPORT : I learned lots of new things I didnt know we can make viewers verify email before they chat and followeronly mode Im also using blacklist words on nightbot and automod on Twitch Thank you guys for all your support <3 I wont be scared to stream tomorrow lol my faith in this community was resurrected You all made my day awesome again
40,For two weeks running theres a particular clip being recommended to me at the top of my homepage that Ive no interest in viewing Theres no way make it go away as far as I can tell short of watching it  YouTube has an option to block particular videos or channels something thats desperately needed on Twitch Im constantly being recommended content that Twitch insists I want and theres no way tell it to stop
41,Now the trolls have something to fear kinda  lets hope this discourages at least some trolls from doing this  http:wwweteknixcompaypalrefusesrefundtwitchtrolldonatedhugesumsmoney
42,Mainly for smaller streamers because thats where I tend to hang out They dont get a penny from this 30sec1min unskippable ad I like to browse through lots of streams but having to watch an ad EVERY single stream is making me want to jump out window Bigger streamers I understand but having it this way is actually putting me off checking out those smaller streams who need the support more I tried adblock doesnt work anymore I tried some alternate player for Chrome it looks awful btw but somehow I still get ads I tried Firefox still same I am at a loss I just want to support smaller streams and not deal with bullshit Whether you realise it or not time is the most valuable thing you can give someonesomething because you can never get the time you give back but you can always get money back and I would rather not spend so much of my time on twitch watching ads Anyone feel same or am I just a dickhead and is there a fix?
43,Constant preroll ads switching from stream to stream streams that go live dont show up in your feed till 23 minutes after the initial mobile notification also applies to desktop twitch and the biggest problem is the delay Literally no matter how perfect your wifi is the delay is about 15 seconds minimum which makes reading the chat useless It also doesnt help that preroll ads seem to make the delay even worst making the video load later than it should The YouTube gaming app itself has a minimum of a 1 second delay when viewing livestreams on a good connection on mobile Twitch app developers get your shit together
44,So I bought some bilberry jam and wanted to try it on my stream Turns out I was allergic Ive never been allergic to anything in my life so I brushed off the symptoms burning lips sweating raspy breathing I just thought my apartment was hot I was trying to make light of the situation and joke about it with my viewers literally we were all like lololol hopefully Maple doesnt die   Anyway I started feeling worse so I called the stream and realized I was actually very sick  completely covered in hives I messaged my discord and told them what was up  ONE OF MY VIEWERS WAS AN EMT He called me calmed me down and told me what to do and how to get help Another one of my viewers I already knew him personally picked me up and drove me to get Benadryl   I just moved to a new city and dont really know anyone so the advice and help meant so much to me Its really great Twitch not only provides a fun community to hang with but also in this case friends to help me take care of myself when facing a serious medical problem   Yay Twitch <3
45,For when you just dont know what you want to watch I think there should be an option you can click that gives you a random streamer thats online Kind of like tinder It could also help people grow 
46,Yesterday Russian authorities started blocking Telegram popular encrypted messenger and Amazon and Google server ips countrywide As a result over 20 MILLION ips and ip gates were banned which resulted in massive nationwide blocking and collapse of many services that used amazon and some googlebased servers Unfortunately twitch is also BLOCKED NOW for most Russians including me So i had to use VPN and TOR to write a message on actual twitch website I have literally no idea how i can stream with twitch in this situation And i am a fulltime twitch affiliated streamer and i just get 2000: Network Error now Will have to stream on youtube for the time  being  http:downdetectorrunerabotaettwitchkarta   My video proof: https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=4XFm6bFmTs4
47,Ive commented this twice and both times people have liked the idea so I figured Id post it so more people can see it       I think there needs to be a button at the top of either the games in browse for if you dont knowcare what game you watch or above the streamers in a certain game category This button would have 2 option one where you put in the maximum amount of views you want the streamer to have and the second option being a certain language if possible This could help people branch out from watching 3 or 4 of the biggest streamers and also help smaller streamers grow
48,Ive finally finished releasing my huge [OBS Studio MASTER CLASS]https:wwwyoutubecomplaylist?list=PLzo7l8HTJNKIKzM_zDicTd2u20Ab2pAl  the most indepth OBS tutorial course ever made       This includes 46 individual excerpt episodes covering topics ranging from OBS setup basics to advanced tricks to do things you havent thought of in OBS and a full 55 hour course video with all of the topics plus some bonus topics included as well      I will still be making more individual tutorials for OBS in 2018  including covering more advanced plugins and any new updates  but wanted to share the course here as I truly believe it to be a valuable resource    
49,For the past two months Ive been getting these creepy ass ads on mobile they have no sound with the exception of one and are all shot from what looks like a bad cell phone What are they you ask? Well here is the list  1 A girl standing in the middle of a open field walking slowly toward the camera as the camera person backs up  2 A birthday cake collapsing on itself  3 A car following a truck on what seems to be a high way a mattress falls out of the truck and the car swerves off the road and the camera stares at the mattress  4 A person walking slowly into a lake  5 A wheelchair in an empty room This is the one with sound and it is of a baby crying  These arent advertising anything at all or if they are it isnt clear  These are basically the only ads I get on mobile anymore and I have never seen these ads on anywhere but mobile  So yeah cut it out  Edit: So I saw CO poisoning as a theory I had my office and home checked CO levels are normal in both places I cant have my gym checked where Ive seen these ads as well its not a place where I hold any authority
50,Twitch has sent out an email detailing the action theyre taking in support of Net Neutrality      If you havent seen the email it reads as follows:      > Hey Broadcasters  > On July 12 Twitch along with other social media sites will be calling attention to the US Federal Communications Commissions FCC decision to repeal Net Neutrality rules   > These rules serve as the framework that prevents carriers from abusing their position of power  For example certain rules prevent ISPs from giving priority to specific sites over other sites slowing down access to sites that refuse to pay an ISP for a fast lane and blocking sites based on the decision of an ISP    > We believe that it is important that we not only lend our voice to this issue but educate the community and empower action  How will we do that: on July 12 all the Twitch global emotes will be replaced with a spinning wheel for 24hours  > A banner ad at the top of the channel page will serve as a call to action to users and link them to a page designed by the Internet Association  From there one can read more about this topic and send a letter to their respresentiative and the FCC  > Although this issue is timely in the US we are aware that it exists in other countries  We will continue to advocate in ways that support our creators you  And we encourage you to join us and educate us on similar concerns impacting you  > Thanks > Twitch      I look forward to seeing what people think of this      GLHF    Z
51,Hey guys Im like brand new to streaming and Im used to not having people in chat Tonight this dude comes in from a previous lobby I was playing with and chats with me for most of the stream and it felt awesome to have someone in my chat so shout out to all the people that watch small streamers
52,On Sept 5th I got sick It started with some pain in my stomach and developed into a fever I typically stream 6 days a week for around 67 hours a day and the 4th was the last day I could do that  My fever quickly grew to 102 and then 1035 I took some medication but did not see a doctor Within 2 days I broke the fever but then started experiencing other problems such as dizziness and the fever kept returning This went on until the 13th when I did finally see a doctor at my clinic they couldnt find the problem though and required me to go have some blood tests done and return the following week  During this time I was updating my stream once a week to tell them what was going on and how I was doing On the 14th I updated them again and I was in bad shape Some of my viewers were insisting I go to the ER immediately I told them that was not such an easy decision I am in the USA and have no insurance A trip to the ER is not an easy choice to make but my viewers persisted and immediately started setting up a GoFundMe telling me to go and they would handle the money for it  I became emotionally overwhelmed with what was happening and told them that I would go to the ER right away I had a friend drive me there and as they started running tests they found an infection in my left kidney which ended up being Ecoli  They admitted me to the hospital that night where I remained for a week During that time they found a second infection which was staph in my blood as well as pneumonia and my stomach was full of gas which made it near impossible for me to eat for the previous week  My viewers may well have saved my life by getting me to go to the ER on the 14th I didnt know how sick I really was and at 47 I have become accustomed to riding things out but that wasnt working this time They raised over 2000 between the GoFundMe and paypal donations I ended up getting covered through an HCAP in Ohio which should cover most of the bills but does have some exceptions  I cant begin to tell you how overwhelmed I wasam by how my viewers came together to help me when I needed it I can never repay what they did for me I am still going in for daily IV treatments at the hospital but I did start streaming a few hours a day again this week  Im not here to promote my stream or anything else with links I just wanted to share my amazing story of how I am still here because of how great my viewers are
53,Im usually in the exact same boat youre in TodayI streamed Overwatch to nobody for 2 hours Played some of the best comp Ive ever played Switched to Hearthstone and wow I peaked at 11 viewers got a sub 3 follows 5 donation and chatsong request was active as hell Im not expecting anything for tomorrow stream but Im so motivated to stream to nobody because I want that feeling again I know I kind of rambled but the point was dont get discouraged Just be yourself and let the viewers come  Edit  Wasnt expecting this to be seen by so many people Keep your head up everybody 
54,I just finished watching the PGL match CSGO and I tried to switch to another stream and nothing happened I exited Twitch and reopened and nothing happened I put Twitchcom in the address bar and it just sat their with just a blank white screen http:imgurcomarnt3M Light a candle  Edit: Twitch has posted on twitter they are looking into the issue http:imgurcomanlCgu Mobile is currently working  Edit: By now Im sure you know but Twitch is back up
55,Im a pretty easy going guy but due to my willingness to give advice and the nature of my networking I tend to attract a lot of newer and smaller streamers to my chat The biggest cliche to the point where its become a joke with my regulars now is how often new streamers think its acceptable to stop in for one or two lines of chat and say Just wanted to say hey before I start my stream or something similar  Now dont get me wrong Im not worried about my viewers leaving but it really rubs me as disrespectful This is not something youre saying casually You want other people in the chat to read that and come watch you This is BAD FORM Have some respect for other streamers and wait for it to come up organically before you bring up your own Twitch
56,This is going to kill the population people will swap over to youtube This is insane
57,twitch get on it or at least bttv make it happen
58,Whats up with this new layout? It looks disgusting? Any way to change it back?
59,I cant express enough about how encouraging it is when someone new enters my stream and chats I know I myself dont really watch small streamers but I cant express enough how much a single viewerchatter means to us small streamers So thank you to those who use their twitch time to watch new streamers who might not have the attractive view counts We all have to start somewhere and viewers like you are who make it possible
60,To those of you who engage visit or to just keep the chat entertaining with those of us who average at around 15 viewers at a time you guys are AWESOME Even if its just us streaming and having 1 or 2 of you in the chat just talking and getting to know you makes streaming that much more worthwhile    A HUGE thank you from us small streamers    Edit: And if by chance any of us ever do make it I hope we never lose sight of where we came from and never forget THOSE few viewers who were with us from the beginning 
61,It sucks because if your watching a streamer and while theyre mid conversation you get an ad you lose the immersion and its like every 10 minutes I mean I guess its lucrative but now if I open a stream and see an ad I tend to close it out and switch to YouTube or Netflix FeelsBadMan 
62,Hello Streamers I made a small tool called SpotifyStreamWidget A small Tool for Streamers to show the current Track of Spotify to your Viewers Completly customizable to fit your style The Tool is complete free and open source I would like to get some Feedback so I can add more features and fix bugs You can get it on GitHub:  [check it out]https:marcopnsgithubioSpotifyStreamWidget  [Also check out the Twitch Music Library]https:musictwitchtv
63,[Twitch has officially confirmed that they have been blocked in China]https:moneycnncom20180921technologytwitchchinablockedamazonindexhtml   China has really been [cracking down on online gaming recently]https:moneycnncom20180830technologytencentgamingchinaindexhtml?iid=EL interesting to see how people will react to being blocked from the 1 streaming service
64,Taken from twitter: @Slasher Twitch laid off more than 25 people from the Twitch Studios and CommunityMarketing teams yesterday including several highprofile employees who have been with the company since Twitch began sources said People were told that Twitch had overhired and this was to readjust  [Tweet link]https:twittercomSlasherstatus979741722912722944
65,Was out walking with my wife in a large shopping center before the shinedowngodsmack concert tonight and a random person came up and was like Dude I watch you on Twitch can I have your pic?  Mind you I am not even at a 1000 follower count or anything and this was the first person to ever do this  It was probably one of the weirdest and awesome experiences I have ever experienced  It left me with an awkward grin for like 4 hours  Anyways carry on my friends
66,Just pulled up DrDisrespects stream 5 ads were played totaling about 2 minutes before it actually went on to the stream Thats insane  x200B;  It played the Football ad with the PogChamp and the trap music  Then it played a Totinos Pizza Rolls ad  Then it played a Totinos Pizza Rolls ad; yes again  Then it played an Acer Predator ad  It played the Football ad with the PogChamp and the trap music; yes again  x200B;  I am all for ads and supporting streamers and supporting Twitch the platform itself that provides the means of streaming But the aggressiveexcessive ads are upsetting everyone I myself get to a point where I just close my browser when 3 sets of ads pop up while Im just chillin trying to watch someone I enjoy  x200B;  I make my living on Twitch from my viewers subsbits etc and I dont want to see the platform destroyed by these ads  x200B;  Regular Twitch viewers what are your thoughts on the recent changes regarding ads?
67,Some of us were never meant for this Some of us find it tiring to be on every day after a long day at work   The numbers affect us Sure its a hobby but why arent more people in our channels? Are we ugly? Boring? Are we really that bad?   We doubt ourselves and throw our confidence away Its taking a toll on our mental health   I am was? a streamer that averaged to 10 viewers on good days and 2 viewers on bad days with about 400 followers after 15 years of streaming On my latest streams I was always so grumpy and stiff Everything made me mad The chat the game I go to other channels that I am a regular at and read the chat and I get frustrated People say things just to say something and show that they are edgy and cool Are those the people I want to hang out with? Nah  So I went ahead and pulled the plug I am not good at it I am not the next Ninja I am not the next Lirik I knew this I just confirmed it    Instead its time to do other things for those 3 hours every weekday after work Im learning Unity and I am loving it   Its okay to give up Some of us are meant for other things   Good luck everyone
68,Im a very smallnew streamer only averaged a few viewers here and there if I was lucky but for the most part was by myself However last night I got a host for around 100 viewers I kept 30 viewers until I got off and it was the greatest feeling ever I had the greatest day ever I love this community so much
69,First of all I love the channel but as an avid fan spending a lot of time watching the stream I realized a few things   Bob is not answering to our questions in the chat   Might have accidentaly painted the same paintings a few times   During my investigation I ve come across a few questionable sources that are stating that Bob has passed away  What do you think? 
70,To avoid calling out or bashing the streamers involved I will keep this nameless  Tonight it was pretty disgusting to log into twitch and see a wannabe cam girl at the top of the viewers list for CSGO   This streamer in question had 10k viewers was in a leotard drunk and asking for her viewers to pay 100 and she would take a shot   I dont believe this streamer ever played a single game just opened a case every 10 minutes or so inbetween ass shaking and chest squeezing  When another popular streamer played an oddshot clip on his stream That came directly from the streamer in questions stream not 10 minutes earlier he was warned against a ban by a Staff member if he played any clips like that again   This is unacceptable for a game streaming platform   To think someone could be checking out twitch for the first time only to see a bunch of internet warriors drooling over a half naked chick is pretty sad
71,Using a weekend day like satsun where tons of big name streamers either just dont stream at all or everyone stream on another site like hitbox  Dont actually know how effective it will be but it could help
72,Seriously Today I was going through Final Fantasy XII: Zodiac Age and was struggling to keep my enthusiasm and commentary going after hours with no views Then suddenly I see in my Restream client that someone had started watching My mood perked right up and I immediately felt more engaged with what I was doing   I was happy playing through it and commentating to my one lurking viewer Just knowing that one person was hopefully enjoying the experience with me was enough to keep me going strong Its so easy to burnout when youre putting effort into providing commentary and insight on a game youre playing with nobody listening but when you get that one viewer that sticks around it makes it all worthwhile To those of you who give us small streamers a chance even you lurkers thank you
73,I have nothing against people streaming and trying to make it on twitch because its not easy But every day I come to this sub and my feed is filled with some small streamer post saying thanks for checking them out or some roundabout way to flex their channel Im sure some of these posts might be genuine but Im also sure the vast majority is just trying to use it as self promotion   If you want to make it on twitch stream 5 days a week for 5 hours Stream the same time and the same game Set small goals for yourself Talk non stop about what you are doing even if its obvious Read your chat Check your audio levels Go back watch your broadcast and see if you enjoy watching it or not and fix issues from that  You need to grow organically giveaways promotions gimmicks and things of this same nature dont really help you in the long run   Start a YouTube channel and upload a video every week or twice a week   To be honest if you dont have time to do all of this dont expect to become a twitch streamer Sure do it for a hobby or just for fun but if you want to make money and pay bills you need to do all of this at the bare minimum   People might not like the harsh truth here but someone needs to be the bad cop here and tell everyone that in a world where participation trophies are given out twitch will not give you anything unless you grind the long slow hours for every single viewer you convert to a regular       Edit: this was just a small rant post not supposed to be on top of the sub Reddit mystifies me sometimes lol   Donate blood or plasma this week at the local blood bank in your area make some money to buy yourself something nice  Edit2: Yes I stream 7 days a week 10pm6am I have made roughly 800 a month for the last year on twitch  I do twitch for fun not money this is a hobby for me until I can commit myself to the job side of it  I edited this post because info was irrelevant to the discussion   Ill make another post later on since people are asking
74,https:twittercomLinusTechstatus1008752236027973632  Linus Tech Tips has recently received a Strike on YouTube for uploading a video announcing that they were going live on Twitch YouTube is citing a portion of their spam policy that says that the main purpose of the content cannot be to drive traffic to other sites Something to be aware of for those of us who like to promote our streams with announcement videos on YouTube
75,As the title says Twitch should add a 18 section where your account has to be confirmed 18 to access here all the lewd streamer can have their streams ie bodypainters and so on Ofc no cam site level stuff This section could also have its own advertisements rules or something prolly plenty of advertisers willing to put their adds on such streams  Its better to have this than sanitize the platform completely
76,Im pretty sure most people know by now about the incident with a female streamer and her cats last night She choked the living hell out of her cat last night and supposedly did it to another cat to show him who the boss is  Will she get banned? Lets make a checklist   Obnoxious outfits on every stream   Sub button   Attractive questionable female  Well all signs point to no based on our checklist   This girl deserves to be banned LONG before this She used to be a literal camgirl where she did acts with stuffed animals and took donations to get naked Just like a certain other female streamer shell probably just get a warning and absolutely nothing will happen   
77,Today I realized that 8 dollars worth of bits disappeared from my account when I tried to cheer for one of the two streamers I watch This got me confused and lead me down a very concerning route Apparently without any emails or notifications at all somebody from Russia has been logging into my mostlyinactive account and using my oftunused Twitch Prime subscriptions AND NOW my bits on very suspicious Russian channels And it doesnt seem like its just me The accounts that I was magically following and spent subsbits on had very low views and were clearly inactive but they had OVER 30 THOUSAND FOLLOWERS EACH cant name them here or the post will be removed This leads me to believe that some Russian botnet is running through known passwords on twitch logging into inactiveinfrequented accounts and following these channels to boost egos of the botters? often stumbling upon accounts with bits and Twitch Prime to use these to give themselves a bit of money along the way likely stealing credit card info as well PLEASE if you have an unsecured account no 2fa and unique password remedy this NOW Twitch does not notify you by email of new login locations like many other websites so this could be happening under your nose Please protect yourselves from this It would also be great of Twitch to investigate these suspicious accounts that I and clearly MANY others were following without our knowledge Dont end up like me with 8 dollars of lost bits
78,I thoroughly enjoyed finding streams with very little or no following and just chatting with them while they game A very wholesome experience Thanks to the hackers that fucked up Youtube s I found a new love for Twitch
79,This is my NET application for Windows that will display Twitch chat on top of a windowed or borderless windowed game Typically would be used by single monitor streamers who need to see chat while playing This application will attempt to always stay on top and its fully transparent You can move and resize the app as you need and you can control the app through a system tray icon This app has been approved by the rTwitch mods  [Screenshot 1]https:iimgurcomvDZiQDKpng  [Screenshot 2]https:iimgurcomTOIVYkzpng    You can download the app on github here:  https:githubcombafflerTransparentTwitchChatOverlayreleases  Under Assets grab the file TwitchChatOverlayv06zip     Extract the zip file and open the folder and look for TransparentTwitchChatWPFexe  Optional right click on the application file and choose Send To > Desktop create shortcut  Windows protected your PC message may appear which is the Windows Defender Smart Screen Youll need to click More info and then Run anyway Youll only have to do this the first time you launch it  After launching the program for the first time youll need to set your twitch channel in the settings You can click the button at the topleft to open settings rightclick the black border at top or rightclick the icon in the taskbar  You can move the application by clicking and dragging the thin black border at top and you can resize it by clicking and dragging the grip at the bottomright  To hide the borders just click the [o] button in the topright or rightclick the icon in your taskbar  [Image to show where you can toggle borders and show settings]https:iimgurcomB3SDcrkpng    Some known issues that Im still working on    The resize grip on the bottomright is a bit hard to click on  Doesnt work for fullscreen games but its probably something I wont be able to easily implement because it would require some type of DirectX hooking which is not my expertise  ~~You cant always click through the chat usually its fine anywhere in the transparent parts but clicking on textemote will prevent you from clicking on your actual game that is behind it~~ edit: v04 or higher will let you click through the app now as long as you hide borders    Any other issues bugs or feature requests feel free to [create an issue on the github project page]https:githubcombafflerTransparentTwitchChatOverlayissues or contact me here on reddit Ill be here in the comments if you guys have any questions
80,I know Im not the only one  EDIT: To all of the people saying that they already do this Whooosh Of course they do I just want them to surface that data And yes that data is valuable to Twitch again duh but it is valuable more so in aggregate not so much on an individual level and that is what I am hoping we get: our own personal data about what and whom we have watched as individual viewers and for how long Sorta like how Steam shows that youve played this game or that game for however many hours
81,I cant honestly bring myself to use Bits when so much is lost in the middle compared to Paypal From a donator POV I know Im not going to chargeback but I hear stories of streamers having to deal with that Bits seem much more reliable to receive but the donation loses a lot of value when going from Donator to Streamer if youre an honest donator compared to the ~4 Paypal takes   Obviously its a processing fee  extra for Twitch pockets but if Twitch lowered the  they charged extra on the bits I think it would be used much more often resulting in more profits for Twitch Even though each transaction it would be less  skimmed off much more would take place resulting in more profit I think   Whats everyones thoughts on this?    Edit: 40 upcharge is referring to the [markup]https:strategiccfocommarkuppercentagecalculation  not the  of Twitch vs the Streamer   Edit 2:  [a quick graph I made of the Markup Vs Donation for PayPal and Bits]http:imgurcomBc1moZxpng  the upcharge is only comparable at 1 and PayPal still is better Past 1 PayPal becomes even more ideal as an even higher  of money goes to the streamer  To compare PayPal to Bits I entered the Markup  for 1 5 15 50 100 and 250 since those are the quantities you can load bits to your account in
82,I donated 1 to a twitch streamer who then said my full name to the stream I told him to stop and he continued giving out my info on stream so I filed a chargeback claim on the paypal donation The streamer is now calling me not even sure how he got my phone number telling me my address and bringing up my business website He has called me 3 or 4 times now What should I do? Any help appreciated  Edit: For those wondering if I said something offensive that caused this I said something about being bad at the game but I said it in a jokingly matter Sure maybe it can be perceived as me being an ass but I still dont see that as an excuse to share someones information  Edit 2: Most of you have been more than helpful After posting this he had called back a few more times but didnt say anything meaningful so Im gonna just leave it at reporting his Twitch account Thanks to everyone who helped me out
83,Hello   First off sorry if this pops up in your feed Im really not worried about the votes I just want to get this out there for the search engine folks  This may seem like a wall of text but its actually not that bad    That being said I ended up installing 3 different programs and it was crazy difficult to figure out Im fairly techliterate as well      Heres to hoping this helps someone I had a very simple goal in mind my viewers JAMMING while I just hear it as background music  as Im more concerned with the ingame sounds You can also turn up game sounds for you and not your viewer  Honestly this setup opens a TON of options for streamingprojectorsspeakers  We have a stream room with projector here and now Im able to route a google chrome hulu window  on the projector  JUST to the speakers in the room  where its out of my mic pickup   Thats right  Im able to use my third monitor a projector hanging from the ceiling to project hulu for the whole room without my viewers hearing a thing  This also works if you want to watch shows or listen to music that you dont want on your stream audio      One more final note before I get started Im absolutely not sure this is the easiestbest way to do this but it works            Programs required  Not sure if links allowed easily googleable    Audio Router unless windows 10    Voicemeeter Banana    VBAudio Virtual Cable      After youve downloaded everything and restarted the few times it requires youre ready to begin      Step 1  in Sound options for windows  Select Voicemeeter Input for Playback  Right click and  Set as active and default devices      Step 2  Open Audio Router  Find your music I use Spotify Premium Desktop play a song if it doesnt show up  Click the arrow  route  CABLE Output VBAudio Virtual Cable       Step 3  Open Voicemeeter Banana  while it looks confusing its actually pretty simple  The first 3 columns are physical inputs  The next column contains both virtual sources but we just need 1  The final column is your hardware out and volume mixer        Now you will click the headings to select devices   Set  the first column  as your microphone   Set  the second column  as CABLE Output VBAudio Virtual Cable   Skip  the third column dont need it   Skip  the fourth column these are automatic   Move to the final column select your headphones as the hardware output        Now open OBS and click the settings cog next to Desktop Audio  select CABLE Input VBAudio Virtual Cable   this is spotify  so adjust the volume you want your viewers to hear spotify at Click the cog next to MicAux and select Voicemeeter Output  VBAudio Voicemeeter VAIO as the source psst this is B1 on voicemeeter  this is any audio you route to B1 in Banana as WELL as any desktop audio since VAIO is the source we picked earlier in our sound settings as our default device    Head back over to Voicemeeter Banana now we must tell our audio which channels to go to     You can right click to rename the columns if you want  Column 1 is your mic Column 2 is spotify  but remember we already added spotify to stream so this is just for your headphonesspeakerswhatever you want Column 3 is a spare I dont personally need you can add another source            Now by selecting the different buttons you can tell the sounds where to go:   A1 is your headset B1 is what your stream hears  the VAIO         Now in the last large column youre able to define what sources your headphones hear the 5 sliders are A13 and B12 and how loud  You can also change other audio things here that I wont even pretend to understand but Im sure you can make things sound nicer  [Heres an image of my Voicemeeter Banana setup all said and done]https:iimgurcomkxzr6txpng    The result of my setup is that my viewers will hear spotify at full volume while using the mixer Im able to set it to be very quit for myself  or also jam if I want      I apologize that this is so difficult to read but trust me the alternative of trying to figure it out yourself isnt a good time  I really hope this helps at least one person who was frustrated like I was and Ill be happy      Thank you so much if youve read this far and have a good day :
84,According to [https:lonelystreamscom]https:lonelystreamscom At any given point in time there are about 3000 livestreams on twitch alone with 0 viewers Many more struggle to reach 3 average viewers requirement for affiliate Every day you can see great streamers remain undiscovered by the world at large Today Im bringing you a few tips on how you can help those streamers  x200B;  Twitch is an amazing place to connect people and embrace creativity Every day you can find great streamers with empty chats and barely anyone watching But that is the first step You found them Now lets look at what you can do for them  x200B;  You did it You found a streamer Now what?

Let them know Do you have an idea for a fun chat bot game during breaks? As a part of community streamer will value your feedback but be mindful of when to provide it  some might be better suited for a dm after the stream rather than during it  Clips again  >There are even more things you can do with clips Many websites and subreddit are suited for sharing clips or you can even make them into youtube compilation videos or suggest them for it As long as the streamer is okay with it of course  Host and autohost  >Even if youre not a streamer and even more if you are anyone following you might stumble upon a channel youre hosting or autohosting Autohosts are easily added in Twitch dashboard settings for support without extra effort \\o  Donate things for giveaway  >Do you have those spare keys from Humble Bundles for games you already had? You can donate them to streamer to make giveaways celebrate goals and anniversaries  x200B;  If you have some spare funds and want to do even more look no further   MONETARY SUPPORT  Subscription  >Subscription is one of the staple ways of supporting a streamer You get ability to use their emotes and badge in the chat as a reward Its available from Affiliation and roughly 50 of the money goes to streamer \this varies based on taxes andor custom Partner contracts  Cheering  >Upon purchasing bits from Twitch you can distribute them among any affiliate and partner streamers of your choice Also includes a badge in chat and animated donation emotes 1 bit equals 001 dollar  Subscription and bits are paid out to streamer according to their agreement after reaching minimum threshold 100 dollars at the time of writing this article  Tipsdonations  >Streamers dont need to be affiliatedpartnered to receive direct donations and many will have information about it in their twitch info or as a command This money except for fees is usually usable for streamer immediately  Streamer affiliate links  >Many streamer often have different affiliate links from humble store to amazon Clicking on their link will usually give them a small percentage of the sale you make while costing you nothing extra  Merchandise  >If you want a little something for yourself while supporting a streamer their merchandise often offers shirts mugs posters and more Even better options might be available for art streamers where you might be able to buy original artwork  Wish list  >Streamers often have wish lists Steam wish list for games amazon one for everything from better web cam to cat food Its a great way to give without giving straight money  x200B;  Honorable mention:  Bits for ads  >While bits for ads are not stable source of bits and dont work in all of the world usually at least US viewers are able to get bits for free for watching ads that can be sent to any affiliated or partnered streamer  x200B;  x200B;  It often might feel like a single person cant do that much on a big platform such is Twitch I hope this list provides at least some ideas and while not everyone will make it as a huge partnered streamer there are many ways to make even the small ones feel appreciated  What do you do to support your favourite streamer? Have I forgotten anything? Let me know in the comments below
85,This 100 discourages me from checking other streams as I like to switch streams up a lot but if I have to watch 4 30 second ads every time fuck that shit 
86,I saw this in a chat today and it made me really mad This was in reference to chat asking random personal questions and the streamer shrugging them off   You are not entitled to anything other than what the streamer wants to broadcast Theyre letting you into their life and can be as private or open as they want Putting them on the spot and expecting them to answer your question in front of 10 100 1000 people is just so toxic and shows a lot of entitlement   Rant over thank you
87,It should be like youtube anything over 15 seconds has a skip button It would make the overzealous and stupid ad experience twitch has slightly more bearable  
88,Tokyo is Getting Its Own Twitch Stream   Announced via @Franke Twitter    Twitch has partnered with PROBLEM to debut the firstever city specific live stream on its network    The Tokyo stream will feature exclusive Tokyobased content from local creators and personalities and while some of the creators have existing Twitch channels most of the new and exclusive content will debut beginning in mid May    The program is aiming to provide a more honest and youthful perspective of the city seen IRL through the eyes of both natives and expats  a stark contrast to Japans more traditional tourism marketing and in many ways its massmarket global image    And while you should expect unique firsthand perspectives on Japanese culture commerce and cuisine everything from underground experiences to systemic and taboo social issues will also be explored   
89,Hey guys  I made [twitchraidslive]https:twitchraidslive which is a site where viewers can watch random channels together The channel on the site can change every 5 minutes and viewers vote on the next channel from a pool of random channels I made the site to help me discover new games and streamers Please check it out and let me know what you think  By the way the text on the site isnt great on small screen devices like phones It is usable in landscape mode though  Thanks  Edit: Thank you so much for all of the great suggestions Ill try work on some of them tonight  Edit2: Ive updated the site with some of the suggestions: offline check not great because the api lags by ~3 min but better than nothing periodic updates to image and view count of the choices and indicating your current vote  Edit3: Join the discord: https:discordggNHrqGey : Ive released an update to limit the amount of large streamers that can show up and fixed a few bugs
90,https:blogstreamlabscomstreamlabsobslivestreamingreinvented4ddf8324f395  Thought this was an interesting release Would it be better now to use this as opposed to separately having OBSStreamLabs open?
91,Seriously people Dont do this  https:iimgurcomtw6OmL6png
92,======= REASON FOR REPOST  MODS PLEASE READ =======  The info regarding the site can be found below this little paragraph is to the mods  I posted this 2 days ago and everyone said its was great guide but a mod delete it  Under your rules its says  >Currently the following types of advertisements are allowed  >Guides  This website is 100 a guide a guide of what times to play It has no adverts not affiliate links just 100 a guide  To respect your decision I followed you request system process and have been waiting over 48 hours and had nothing back  I then contacted ALL the mods over a day ago and no one has replied back to me  So Im going to post this again as I dont believe it violates any rules  ===========  REPOST RANT ================  Ive created a website called [Twitch Strike]http:twitchstrikecom  Ive seen a lot of people asking:   what is the best game to stream?  when is the best time to stream?   And as we all know there is no one answer Popular games are over saturated with channels and regarding times its impossible to say due to each game having its own demographic  So Ive created a website that updates every hour to show you:   What to play Games with low channels broadcasting but high views  What not to play Games with high channels broadcasting but low views  Heat map of every game So you can see channels views ratio over a week  These stats are updated every hour so What to play will change every hour  The website isnt perfect just yet but I will be working on it more over the next month and the next update will allow you to log in and input the games you own Then before you broadcast you can quickly sign in and see what games out of your collection are currently high in demand but have a lower channels broadcasting  Also longer the site is up more of an average it can generate So be sure to check back over time to see it change  I hope you find this tool useful and Ive wrote a quick [FAQ]http:twitchstrikecomfaqs that explains ratio vs channel vs viewes that might be worth a quick read  Edit if the reports dont load disable adblock  I have no adverts anyway So you are safe but reports are coming in ad block is stopping the files from loading I will look in to this issue ASAP 
93, I am not encouraging any witchhunting or riots Just want some feedback from the community  Will twitch ever speak out about a streamer who has broken their ToS multiple times on different occasions? I find is BS that if a small streamer did break a ToS Rule 100 FULLY ACCIDENT that the channel would be banned within 24 Hours easy Is twitch really that hungry fro a few Hundredthousand dollars despite being a BILLION Dollar Company?????  EDIT: Marking this as NSFW for the purpose of links posted here  EDIT 2: The person in question has now been suspendedbanned   EDIT 3: The streamer only received a 30 Day Ban  Edit 4: Shoutout to uITTFanboykids for the [saltiness]http:iimgurcomSA8riGxpng 
94,I find this more hilarious than anything but I just got an email stating one of my emoticons was declined due to inappropriate content The pic is literally my face from my LinkedIn photo Any idea why it would be tagged as such? Should I just resubmit or take the time to submit a ticket? I looked through the guidelines before submitting my emoticon so I dont think I broke any rules  EDIT: [Im just too sexy for twitch]https:imgurcoma18Nil  EDIT 2: I resubmitted the pic last night and woke up this morning with a newly approved emote Thanks for all the hilarious replies and Ill see you all online Happydad Happydad Happydad
95,So i filed a DMCA and the videos were removedBUT then i got hit with the Copyright counter notificationin which he stated that he can use that content because it was made public?  Nowthe videos that i took down were not in the line of fair use policy A large portionschunks of unedited stream content and my gameplays uploaded in parts  Now i have a few days to send some kind of proofevidence to youtube? Im not to familiar on what evidence should i be sending here?   Any help appreciated 
96,On the same day every week twitchtv should play a movie for everyone to enjoy This would add an element of a larger whole community instead of a community linked to a certain game or a streamer The chat on the movie would be crazy yesbut it would also be fun Can you imagine 50000 or so people all shouting at one person in the movie at the same time or if a dog were to die the amount of crying faces that would be posted This would make the whole experience very fun for all of the viewers  
97,When I joined this website 6 years ago I was extremely happy to find a place with this much dedication for gaming and the community resonated really well with me  Now as a college student whenever I talk to other people about Twitch more and more people actually know what it is which makes me happy but the reasons why they know Twitch definitely dont make me happy Most people I talk to when Twitch is brought up start listing the most stereotypical camgirl things you can think of Im not going to go into detail because there are a lot of females on Twitch that are genuinely entertaining and I feel bad that they are represented in such a poor way but personally this is not the public image that I want my favorite community on the internet to have  I believe that the IRL section should be broken up into other sections Travel Fitness etc because it would break up the huge section on the front page and show off the games more on a gaming website as well as give those other sections distinct purpose and allow content creators buried underneath the masses of webcam shows to flourish in a fresh category    I know a lot has changed about Twitch in the past year and the path its going deeply saddens me I know some of you have to feel the same way and I know my feedback isnt perfect but Im hoping the overall message can make a change
98,So it finally happened guys After 2 weeks of talking to myself and the occasional friend from work dropping by I got a random viewer drop by and he stayed for 23rds of the stream before he had to go I was playing a new game Slay The Spire but luckily this viewer knew about the game so ended up giving me some tips that led to me defeating a boss and clearing a floor  He even was nice enough to say I was a great streamer and give me a follow This was just the boost I needed after a pretty hard day at work Heres hoping I can return the favor and make someones elses day pretty soon
99,Hello   Ive recently created a tool called  Stream Maker  to let you easily create your own overlays banners and panels for your stream  It is very easy and quick to use because it is based on themes: you choose a theme and then you customize the colors the content socials infos camera position etc Moreover you dont even have to create an account to use all the features of the tool  Youll be able to download the results for free but they wont be 1080p and a very discreet watermark will be added or to pay to download them in all resolutions and without watermark Exceptions for panels which are totally free  The website is here [https:strmakercom]https:strmakercom and if you want to directly give a try to the tool this is the direct link: [https:appstrmakercom]https:appstrmakercom   I regularly add themes and features so if you have any feedback Im willing to hear them as I want to continue to improve it  Have fun
100,A hearth stone streamer gets so drunk he passes out nothing happens  A none partner speed runner gets 24 hour cut off because the speed run requires idling  What the actual Fuck twitch  eidt: my phone autocorrect is fucking bad
101,The ELEAGUE Boston Major just set another record for most viewers of a single channel on Twitch: https:iimgurcomAGkkUYqjpg  The [previous record]https:pbstwimgcommediaC3XLz0lWEAALEWsjpg:orig was also set by them at the ELEAGUE major in January 2017  
102,I just noticed that this streamer JennyTheSquirrel  Jenny Seol  KpopBabyJenny is literally asking people to donate money to her to cure her depression She has been flooding her stream with nonstop crocodile tears all the while she has a donation tracker on her stream that basically tells viewers that they will help her overcome PTSD by donating cash Her bot tells her to help Jennys healing journey by buying games using her G2A code It really says that its like shes not even trying to hide her intent [Ive appropriately reported her for scamming]http:iimgurcomPBuTpBgjpg  This isnt a charity stream its someone plainly and clearly monetizing the topic of depression for personal profit Its hideous and offensive to anyone who has ever suffered depression or known someone who has taken their life Is Twitch really allowing this? Is this fair game now? This is no different than all of those troll streamers who threw pretend fits for hours knowing it would bring attention and money Most of them were rightly banned Will Twitch do the right thing now or should the message go out that troll streamers fake crying for money are welcome back? If so lets message all the ones who were banned and get them to return since those rules arent being enforced anymore  If however anything she is doing is honest and legitimate then I wholeheartedly apologize Jenny Seol I wish Id known that cold hard cash cures depression back when I was in the worst parts of it maybe Id have robbed a few liquor stores instead of cutting myself and wanting to die Youre a real inspiration  Just as I was writing this someone donated to get her up to 1000 Youre a real hero Jenny No doubt that person saved a life No doubt  I hope she submits her donation trackers to research psychologists it would be very useful to know exactly how much money can instantly cure depression and PTSD From that point on human suffering can be fought with direct fundraising    [http:helptwitchtvcustomerportalemailsnew]http:helptwitchtvcustomerportalemailsnew  That is a link to directly email Twitch As we all know they dont really care that much when you report for nongaming content so shove that meme out a window and do something meaningful Report her for SCAMMING Take one minute and send them an email using that form showing them that youre serious about wanting to rid Twitch of such manipulative and harmful behaviors Letting them know that youre willing to contact their advertisers wouldnt hurt either I doubt their advertisers want to be associated with people faking depression for pure profit  Some people have already taken to Twitter to ensure that this kind of corrupt and unethical behavior is stopped Social media can be used for good to show Twitch that you care about this topic and you wont just let it happen Manipulation and corruption can be stopped if you make your voice heard
103,You dont HAVE to donate to someone If you want to ask a question and they have I dont know 120k viewers but theyre snapping at you because you asked a question theyve heard 300 times because lets face it that happens Stop supporting them You are literally their livelyhood and if they are taking YOU for granted then STOP worshipping them like a god   You already give them ridiculous money in subs alone why even donate?    If you donate 20 to ask a stupid question and they get mad even though it takes them literally 1 minute to read and reply why bother with THAT streamer? Find someone else
104,I just refreshed a channel and typed LUL in chat and it doesnt look like the other ones Is this some sort of golden Kappa or what? 
105,[Like what the fuck is this bullshit? I feel like Im on a 2005 scam website]http:imgurcomapuFQC
106,After the m0e and csgodiamonds crap And now at least 3 prominent streamers as pointed out by h3h3 also doing shady stuff Its time twitch stopped being used as a medium to promote such gambling activity that is clearly marketed towards kids
107,30 second ad before you open the stream 30 second ads at random intervals in the middle of the stream Its getting really obnoxious
108,Hey guys  Sorry I am posting this on a throw away account I obtained this information from someone I looked up to: Always had tons of viewers tons of support etc but with the closing of this service he decided to quit and come clean instead of get caught otherwise Possibly you guys will get the information on him later on ~2k viewers average lots of 100k clips etc but for now I will keep his name out of it and mine as I dont want to be affiliated to this stuff in any way Really sad and devastated that the person I looked up to was boosting for years now Goes to show what Twitch has come to :    The biggest site for viewer boosting has now officially closed its doors  Twitch has been pushing their lawsuit against them and plenty of other sites for about 7 months now since June They finally got to the point where they couldnt get away from TwitchAmazons lawyers and forcefully had to close their doors Every other site on the lawsuit had closed their doors basically as soon as the suit came out but these guys continued All sites on the lawsuit dont provide these services anymore A true victory for Twitch  Not sure if they will stop providing viewers instantly or if they will stop once peoples services run out to avoid charge backs I assume; their control panel still works from what he states but we should start seeing A LOT of streams losing massive amounts of average viewers soon    This is the site that got a lot of streamers banned because they showed it on stream you should know which one it is by just this info    Thought I would share this information as it is pretty damn dope in my eyes Hopefully you guys think so as well Left all the names out and whatnot so I hope this post is fine
109,With this recent drama involving a certain Taiwanese streamer harassing a certain English speaking streamer its becoming very clear that twitch neglects to give proper reasons for actions   Despite not actually breaking of the ToS the English speaking streamer has been banned multiple times without any reason given by twitch where as the Taiwanese streamer encouraging harassment and doxxing hasnt seen any punishment Its quite obvious that other streamers have been banned for their communities causing trouble like this before however much more minor   I dont see how partners are supposed to trust twitch with such a lack of transparency about how they enforce their ToS and what they deem as a bannable offense I would really like for twitch to start actually feeling like a company that enforces their ToS fairly but currently its looking less that that with every passing day
110,Hi there  I have created a chat viewer that allows you to separate interesting chat messages from the copypasta in your chat It splits the chat into two different feeds so you as the broadcaster can keep up with what chat is saying  Here is a short gif showing it in use: https:igyazocomb1bd59f3e3a0867f86702f0e6dc5d461gif  It can be used on desktop or on mobile for IRL: https:iimgurcomO2IX5sYjpg  You can see it used and how the settings are configured here: https:youtube_VbZPYNwgl0   Check it out @ [https:chitchatmape]https:chitchatmape      Update: If you want a standalone Windows application instead of using your browser you can test this experimental exe version:  https:chitchatmapeChitChatwin32x64zip    Features:   Separates messages that fit certain criteria into a separate feed that you can disable entirely if you feel like it  Highlights people you follow on Twitch in green so they stand out  Shows highlighted message when people subscribe  Shows messages that are directed at @you in red  Shows thumbnail and title of youtube links so you dont keep getting rickrolled same with twitch clips  Lightweight and no need to login  Enabledisable if you only want to show subscriber messages allows non subs to speak but you wont see them  Showhide emotes  Showhide badges  Showhide stream preview in top  Light  dark theme  Showhide subscription messages  Customise banned words  Update: Set font size    If there are any requests for features let me know here or on [twitter @mape]https:twittercommape  Thanks for taking the time to check it out
111,Ive been browsing this subreddit a lot since I started streaming and I keep stumbling upon the same types of posts   How do I get 3 concurrent viewers?  How do I retain viewers?  What is the best way to reach affiliate?  Ive tried to refrain from posting mostly sticking to responding to threads in an attempt to be helpful but Ive been getting disheartened seeing these types of posts over and over Most of the time you can tell theyre empty posts meant to be vessels for a fresh twitch url submitted by people who didnt take the time to browse the subreddit and find similar alreadyposted threads Well this post is for them and for everyone else who finds it useful I love twitch and I want to love all of you newcomers but you make it hard sometimes   So how do you get people to check out your stream? How do you get followers? How do you get regular viewers?  Most people expect this to just happen and  dont get me wrong  it can Slowly but surely it can People naturally stumble across your stream chat with you and form a bond Then they come back the next time you stream and it builds from there This is what we all want and in some cases expect to happen but it takes luck in most instances You can help yourself by playing games where you are more likely to get noticed There are lots of posts on this subreddit about that so I wont get into it  What I do want to talk about is what I feel is a helpful mindset to get into which will help you grow and feel like youre working toward something instead of just waiting for it to happen  You have to be willing to give what you expect to receive  You post hashtags on twitter like supportsmallstreamers and pathtoaffiliate and expect these to get people to come to your stream Well do you actively search for these hashtags and visit streams that you find? If no then why do you expect others to?  You expect people to scroll down countless rows of streams to find yours within a saturated game but do you ever do the same?  You want viewers to chat with you so you have something to talk about You want people to come to your stream and stay more than a few minutes You want people to tell their friends about your stream  If you want all of these things I dont think we as small streamers can afford to not be willing to return but in reality initiate the favor   These are a few things I do on a weekly basis that I find funrewarding that have helped me make great friends and garner a small viewership   I search for random hashtags on twitter such as supportsmallstreamers twitchstreamer etc and visit a few streams until I find one interesting and actively watch for at least 30 minutes to an hour Sometimes longer  I find a game like the ones Ive been playing recently and scroll WAYYYYYyyyyy down until I find a stream with an amount of viewers similar to me and a cool thumbnail and do the same as above   I engage with people on twitter who share my interests I follow people I find interesting I comment onlike content I appreciate Be real Dont go fishing for follows because it wont work  I make an effort to be active in chat when doing the two previous things I ask questions of the streamer make comments on their gameplay laugh or respond to things as appropriate   Ill follow and return to a later stream if I like the content I find Im definitely not advocating throwing around empty follows  I only follow people I know Ill watch again If you made an effort to get to know a streamstreamer and their content isnt your thing dont feel bad Just say thanks for the stream and move on We cant expect everyone who watches us to like us Everyone has different tastes    Ill join the discord of streamers I like and become active in the conversations going on Most of these discords have a selfpromotion channel which are also good ways to advertise that you stream without doing so in places where it feels out of place On that note if you post in those discord channels seek them out and watch people who post in them  tl;dr  So the big thing I am trying to get across with this rambling post sorry is that whenever you do something in relation to advertisingpromoting your stream you should make an active effort to later return the favor Search for those hashtags on twitter Scroll down to the bottom of browsing pages and click on one those streams Stick around a stream for more than 5 minutes Interact with the streamer you are watching Follow the streamer if you like their content  You expect people to do this for you but are you willing to do it for them?  Edit 1: I wanted to thank uTryEasySlice for the gold I did not expect this type of response to the thread but I am happy it has been received so well and I ultimately hope it brings the community closer together That was my goal when I decided to post it Also there are a lot of great additions to this topic in the comments so if youre reading this for the first time make sure you scroll down and check them out

113,This is the part where Twitch shits on their hardcore memelord gaming user base in an attempt to get big time viewership and sponsorship If you think this is for the good of the community you are dead wrong Its about putting a nice front on their company so they can extract as much revenue as possible I honestly could care less if I never watched another Twitch stream again but it is funny seeing a company with such blatant contradictory policies and a well established disregard for any sort of order or accountability attempt to seem like they are put together Good luck  Just a joke btw
114,Im wondering if streaming is a young persons game Im in my 50s and dont know if I could pull an audience     I follow a bunch of poker streamers and have streamed a few times to 1 or 2 people tops Now many of these streamers play high stakes poker for example one guy just went deep in a tournament with a 10k buy in My stakes are much smaller and I think might be more relatable to the average player   Between not being a superstar player and my age do you think its worth the effort? I have no delusions about making a living from it but Id like to develop even a small following Thoughts?
115,Dear Twitch  Myself and many other streamers have lost our beloved Programming category on Twitch today This is detrimental to both my own stream and others whom make a living andor benefit of twitch viewership Generally speaking many of us have consistent daily streams and make content revolving around web development and app development  recently this new update out of the blue without any contact to the community has severely harmed our growth and statistics on Twitch Wed like to send a formal message to Twitch and its team to reinstate the category  but first let me further explain the supposed replacement categories and how they arent suitable to our content On Twitch about 90 of our viewers in the aforementioned Programming category came from the browsing feature on Twitch  in which one would search Programming click and then look for a channel to watch Now with the change they can no longer do that May I remind you in this new world of STEM Science Technology Engineering and math  even though a prominent summary of the content in other aspects of society Twitch isnt the place where this keyword is used Since the change we are now prompted to choose Basic Programming a very poor name for a category and a very targeted audience thats less diverse or Science and Technology a category swamped by other streamers with thousands of viewers doing things totally unrelated to programming etc  and this is not okay Let me outline the problems for each Since Basic Programming is very targeted those whom are not just being introduced to programming tend to sway from these categories On the other hand if Science and Technology is swamped by streamers who are conducting streams on the opposite end of the spectrum  we have no exposure In fact to prove I have tried out the new categories  I spent an hour categorizing my stream as both On a normal day in around fifteen minutes I would have fifteen active viewers Now I can only average 34 eventually dropping to 0  x200B;  For those in the Twitch community who are just trying to educate viewers and show off their projects in the works this new change and removal of the Programming Category will slowly kill the programming community on the Twitch platform  \ Repost apologies for the rule break earlier 
116,Im sure I speak for many smaller streamers about this but its such an amazing feeling when you play a game that many others stream and end up getting a new viewer  The fact that someone took the time to scroll all the way down to hop into a stream that may have next to zero viewers is such a nice gesture You make that persons day So thank you for giving others a chance
117,Today while streaming a viewer was curious about the new mass sub gifting Im in my GFS house ATM so I go my channel on her account in her browser just to check how much it costs and stuff I get curious as I see 100 subs for 499 I believe and I wanted to see how much extra would the tax be on that I click the usual checkout button but instead it processes the payment  she had one click pay enabled so it didnt give me the full information before actually paying   And this ladies and gents is how I got an extra 100 subs thank you for reading this
118,My husband really wants to become a professional streamer and I want to do whatever I can to help him make that happen I got him a butterfly microphone thing earlier today to get his yeti up off the desk and it made a huge difference in his sound quality I want to do more little things like this to help him along his dream Just be super supportive and be there for him as he succeeds Ive been trying to read as much as I can about followers and how to build up and get more people watching but I just cant seem to find that anywhere One of the things he keeps happening is people will hop in say nothing and then just leave I cant figure out why that is or how to keep them around a little longer Long enough to follow anyway   So my question is what articles posts etc so I need to read to make it so I can help him grow his following What does he need from me : Thanks in advance 
119,So you want to be an Audio master? Well youve come to the right place  OBSOpen Broadcaster software is an extremely powerful tool For now we will focus on the audio portion of the setup  Mastering the OBS Audio Mixer  Part 1 The audio settings tab in OBS   Go to Settings  Go to Audio  For Sample Rate select 48 khz If this does not work correctly 441khz will work as well  Channels should be set to Stereofor now until they fix VST support Feel free to toy with surround sound settings but dont forget to downmix to mono for your mic Twitch supports 71 so Yeah  Desktop Audio Device should be set to your PRIMARY source of sound In My case That is SpeakersLogitech G933 Gaming Headset  Desktop Audio Device 2 Should be set as SpeakersSteam Streaming Speakers This is important as this will be where we output our streamed music to Twitch Details on why later  MicAuxillary Audio Device should be set to your Primary Microphone In my case MicrophoneLogitech g933 Gaming Headset  the other two micaux boxes are disabled for me Dont worry we can add more speaker sources another way  important  ensure advanced output mode is selected when setting this up thanks bran  320 is the magic number  We need to change some settings in the Output tab as well   Go to Settings  Go to Output  Go to Audio tab  For track 1 Audio Bitrate should be 160 The reason is that it frees up 160 bits per second for video transmission Which gives a noticeable improvement in quality for the video with only minor loss of audio quality  For track 26 320 is the magic number This means that your recording audio will be higher quality  Since recording is not restricted by bitrate so much as Streaming the 160 bits per second is not a big deal This is especially true when recording at 3500090000 bits per second  Steam Streaming Speakers? If you do not have these as an option or do not use Steam You can get [Virtual Audio Cable]https:wwwvbaudiocomCable And assign it here If you donate you can get 2 additional Virtual audio sources to piggyback off of effectively achieving the same result explained below  Alternatively You could piggyback off of other devices Such as your monitor speakersIf run though HDMIDP Realtek Digital Output or other devicesSpeakers USB headsets  Steam Streaming Speakers is from the Inhome streaming feature for steam which allows you to stream to another computer from your Gaming pc We piggyback off of this feature so it is worth it to note that OBS must be OFF and Spotify output set to something else in order to ensure that the InHome streaming feature works properly  What about the Steam Streaming Microphone?  If you like your ears not bleeding and your headset speakers not broken Avoid piggybacking onto this particular audio device It does not work right with OBS with my testing and outputs about 130 Decibals of pain into your ears    Part 2 The Mixer  This is a really powerful part of OBS With it you can apply filters separate your audio into different channels useful for recording to normalize the audio levels and adjust the volumes of the sources that get outputted to the stream  Using the settings from part 1 We will have room for 3 sources of audio by default:   Our Microphone  Our Primary Audio source  And our Music Audio Source  First things first Rename them Right click the text and Select Rename  I use the three in the bullet points above  Now for a littleadvanced magic   Click on the gear next to one of the audio sources and select Advanced Audio Properties  This will bring up a window with all the sources in a list of sorts  Set up the tracks or channels  All sources you want to output to the stream should be selected in the 1 track This is the audio source we output to stream I have a webcam with a builtin mic I unchecked that box as the audio produced by it is atrocious    Set your Primary Audio Source to Track 2  Set your Music Audio Source to Track 3  Set your Microphone to Track 4  Ensure sure all audio sources are checked for Track 1 Except any webcam mics unless you use that mic and any Copyright music source you want to use to listen to music you like This is explained further down  The reason we do this is for recording purposes It gives us a lot more control over our audio in postproduction    Part 3 Audio Monitoring and you  This is where things can get fun Remember that Steam Streaming Speakers we assigned in part 1? Here is where it becomes useful  For Spotify Users  If you use Spotify You may notice that it does not support Playback Device SelectionOr does it?  After some searching I have discovered a feature that is in development by Spotify and it is just that A Playback Device selection option   Using `enableaudiograph` at the end of the Spotify shortcut target address will enable the Playback device selection box  ~~Now a quick disclaimer Using this feature right now does have some drawbacks~~  ~~>Known issues: When running Spotify with enableaudiograph the other Playback settings dont work This will be fixed soon~~  ~~[Source]https:communityspotifycomt5LiveIdeasAllowusertoselectdefaultsounddeviceidip5351~~  ~~So this means Crossfade songs and Set same volume level for all songs options will NOT work Otherwise we can now tell Spotify to output to our Steam Streaming Speakers which will be picked up by OBS~~  Update 041518:  > the crossfade and volume leveler is working with enableaudiograph now >>devxdev  There is a playlist just for us streamers on Spotify the Twitch Music Library Which contains every song approved by Twitch I recommend starting here  >To avoid confusion Ill add straightforward step by step guide for adding that command enableaudiograph So when you click your Spotify shortcut with mouse right and head into properties you should see a box with an installation location in there ie c:usersxxxxxxxxxspotifyexe then just go add that earlier mentioned line at the end so it would look like this:  >c:usersxxxxxxxxxspotifyexe enableaudiograph  >note that you want to make sure it is a SHORTCUT sorry for yelling It does not work with straight added to exe file >>xfounditx  Finally you are going to have to close Spotify and reopen it with the modified shortcut every time you restart your pc This is until it is integrated into the Main Spotify branch bugfree  We can stop here if you dont care to hear the music from Spotify However We are going to take it a step further in the guide  Listen to sources that are output to your Virtual audio device  First we need to set up something in the Advanced settings in OBS  Click Settings > Advanced Under Audio You will see Audio monitoring device It is important to select your headphones for this  Now we can get into the down and dirty of the guide   Click on Edit button in the top left of obs next to file  Click on Advanced Audio Properties  Welcome to a neat little section of obs that goes unseen for most  See that Audio Monitoring tab?  Next to Music Audio Source Click monitor and output then start playing a song You will now hear the Music Audio Source through your Headphones without the need for programs like VoiceMeeter or Virtual Audio Cable Though I still see the uses for Virtual Audio Cable More on that in a bit  Second music Source?  Here is where it really starts to get interesting  Say you hate the music in the Twitch Music Library Well  You can output the audio from the Steam Streaming Speakers to your stream And have a Second Music source from something like VLC that ONLY you hearassuming it doesnt get picked up by your microphone Headset users be aware this will likely not work for you easily Do a test recording to ensure it isnt picked up by the mic Consider buying a cheap Microphone like [The Movo 40 Shotgun mic]https:wwwamazoncomgpproductB0723D3FVL if it is a problem  In your sources tab   Click the   Click Audio Output Capture  With Virtual Audio Cable installed select that Or pick another source that we will be piggybacking on Monitor speakers are great alternatives if you use HDMI or DP inputs Just mute the speakers on the monitor settings If you use DVI or VGA You will need to piggyback on another source  Now we have an additional Audio Output source to work with  Now Go into VLC Media Player and play some Copyrighted materials It is important to NOT be streaming yet   Go back into Edit > Advanced Audio properties  Under Audio Monitoring select Monitor OnlyMute Output  Ensure Monitor Off is selected for our Spotify output  We now stream the Mutedon our end copyright safe music to Twitch And listen to our copyrighted music instead    End notes  I will say that there is a very slight loss of audio quality on the monitoring method but its almost unnoticeable and is a very small caveat of using this method to manage two music sources  And keep in mind OBS only supports a maximum of 6 audio tracks As one is dedicated to the stream output any more than 5 tracks will have to be added in post with your video editor of choice  Credit goes to Youtube user [EposVox]https:wwwyoutubecomchannelUCRBHiacaQb5S70pljtJYB2g for his extensive tutorial materials on OBS Literally Hours of content to set up OBS properly  There is an [upcoming feature]https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=XbkHvQOHpdg for Windows 10 This feature will let users do a lot of the mixing on a perapplication basis further empowering our mixing capabilities I am very excited about this feature but when the update is  live I will have to rebuild the guide from the ground up because I will be making use of this feature Stay tuned guys :  My other guides:  [Audio Mastering 102]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments8ata7waudio_mastering_102_audio_levels_vst_plugins  [Audio Mastering 103]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments8cagujaudio_mastering_103_output_up_to_71_audio_to  [OBS Mastering 101]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments8ary11obs_mastering_101_music_text_on_stream_dynamic  [OBS Mastering 102]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments8e0lmlobs_mastering_102_facecams_and_making_the_picture
120,I honestly dont know what to do there is a streamer with like 40 consistent viewers that every time im in his game shit talks me makes real life threats to me and even goes as far as to come into my stream go to my vods and shit talk me on his stream while watching my vods  His viewers all hate me and bully the fuck out of me Its been going on for like the past month and its all because he thinks Im a bad player Even though im like 500 elo higher than him consistently I have lots of clips and stuff and have reported him but nothing happens It is against the rules to for him to do this? Who can I talk to to at least get him to stop Thanks
121,Even youtube doesnt do this I just got tricked into clicking an ad and going to a different site because I tried to change the sound as it was blaring loud That is pretty disgusting 
122,I am guessing this is one of the last platforms that have long ads that cannot be skipped I have nothing against supporting my fav streamers but when I get stupid Hearthstone ad each time I switch a stream or just every 15 min I am really thinking of turning my UBlock on 
123,If anybody watches demolition ranch they just moved their entire channel archive to twitch because YouTube is deleting their old videos and giving them channel strikes for them
124,BOB OR RIOT
125,The old one felt simpler to use and the constant pop up of the subscribe button when you view a channel is just fuckng obnoxious 
126,I wrote a program to display Twitch chat happening in my channel onscreen over my game   I was watching a show in the tub like an idiot and sent my phone to the briny deep which was how I previously followed chat while I played Overwatch Phone is very very dead but I still want to see my Twitch chat This project was my answer to that problem and since the initial janky version its come quite a long way   The project is fully open source and feedbackcontributions are of course welcome I think its at a pretty happy stage right now for the general public to try out If you dont trust randomguyonReddit me you can grab all the source code read it start to finish and build it yourself If you dont know how there are also Build instructions on the projects main page   Ive put a decent effort into writing up instructions on how to build andor configure it as well as how to set up your game to play nicely with it I suggest you read it It isnt long dont worry   Due to it being prerelease the Windows release version will open a debug terminal when running This just shows network traffic and any warningserrors and can be safely minimized If anything breaks I only ask that if you copypaste the output of this into a bug report that you omit anything that says access_token or refresh_token since those are Your Secret Tokens The only permissions they have are reading Twitch chat streams but you know it doesnt hurt to be safe   Anyway I hope somebody finds it useful    To download the latest build see the Releases section on: https:githubcomdanieloneillTwitchOverlayreleases 12 is the latest for now   All the source code and manual are available for your perusal at: https:githubcomdanieloneillTwitchOverlay

128,Wow I dont stream often I just started a regular schedule after months of technical issues and I was streaming Fallout 4 when I hear this alarm go off and I go What the hell was that?  I set custom sounds on Alert Box and had forgotten the sounds I set until I looked over and saw the alert on my stream preview   I just wow I got bumped up from 3 viewers to 15 and while I wasnt able to maintain the 15 viewers the whole time but I had 9 of them stay almost to the end and I gained 6 follows I have never been hosted before and I hadnt gotten any follows since setting up my stream to its current state   That was something I will never forget I cant stop smiling
129,If you type into game chat in CoD Black Ops 4 it will display your real name from your [Battlenet]https:Battlenet billing info next to your message  If you are streaming when this happens then anyone watching your stream will have your real name
130,A good friend of mine Dylan is currently in the Marines As a result of some serious injuries he sustained while on duty he was unable to attend PAX East this year His favorite twitch personality is Summit1G so I thought it would be great if I surprised Dylan with his autograph I went to the twitch booth found Summit1G and told him my friends story how he really wanted to meet him but couldnt  Without hesitation Summit1G reached into his bag and pulled out his oneofakind twitch partnership Tshirt and signed it with a personal message to Dylan I immediately called Dylan and Summit1g picked up the phone and even talked to him  I just want to say thanks to Summit1G for doing what he did I know this means a lot to Dylan and I cant wait to hear his response when I mail it to him I really wanted to put this out there to thank him and show everyone how much of a stand up guy Summit1G is  TL:DR  Summit1G signed and gave his twitch partnership shirt to my injured marine friend  http:imgurcomaZ8GAT
131,So TL;DR this happened yesterday WARNING: language:  https:twittercomi0ki_LoLstatus958330485884768256  Long version of the story:  I streamed a game with a player that was unhappy with my performance in the game despite us winning it  He came to my stream after the game and harassed me truth be told we were shit talking each other I then said enough is enough and banned him from my stream  Within 1 minute he donates continuing the stream of shit talk and I basically say thanks for the money and ignore his comment    I move on with my stream and what a surprise the guy filed a chargeback  Ive had a little amount of chargebacks in the past so I knew exactly how to handle myself  I did all of the following and recommend you do too:   downloaded the VOD  screencapd the chatlog  screencapd the PayPal receipt  screencapd the StreamAlerts donation  And wrote out a 4 paragraph message to him letting him know I would be escalating it documenting every single thing that happened and showing him that I had proof  The chargeback claimed that he did not receive the service he ordered  I included a screencap of my donation panel explicitly stating that all donations are just that: donations and are not refundable  This is the important part you should take away from this thread  Long story short  I woke up to my 300 safely nestled in my PayPal account  It felt good to win against a jackass trying to abuse the system  The guy was so desperate for my attention that he spent money to try to get the last word in thinking he could further inconvenience me with a chargeback  Guess he underestimated the lengths I would go to :   It wasnt about the 300 at that point it was about not letting him take advantage of the way the streamerviewer relationship works    Remember to make it explicitly clear in your Donation panel that all donations are final and do not promise you any service or product in return  EDIT: Formatting  EDIT2: Its more important that you keep all of the evidence as I did than it is to put no refunds in the panel  Stay safe streamers
132,I saw this screenshot going around some places online today By the looks of it it looks like Twitch has made a breakthrough in stopping viewbotting This is what happens when you try to log in to one of the main botting sites   http:iimgurcom5Sr6X2npng  From the looks of it Twitch has had an update on july 26th at 11:00 UTC 1 We are investigating what they have changed and will extend subscriptions as soon as the bot is operational again Apologies for the inconvenience  Have they done it?
133,I know its nothing new a female gamer receiving death threats but this was my first threat on the Twitch platform All because I was doing a speed run for Detroit: Become Human and one of my fans was upset that I was killing off the player characterswhich is how you do a speed run  I immediately banned him from chat only to find a long series of whispers from him later with the I was just kidding defense  Its not a joke Its not funny and its not something you kid about I blocked the guy after reporting him to Twitch It wasnt even a simple Im gonna kill you for that It was Im going to come to your home address and kill you   Dont be that guy No seriously dont be that guy Death threats are a bannable offense on most social platforms and even if they werent be a better human than that
134,Its hard to explain if youre not here but the line just to get your badge starts at one block and the continues for half a mile before wrapping around another block and then twists back around the way it came and then zig zags up through the convention center entrance   And then after you get your badge you have to go stand in ANOTHER line to get into the convention  Guy on line adjacent to mine had wrapped around for a second time just said he had been in line for three hours and still hasnt gotten his badge and he is way far ahead of me in the line  This is ridiculous and so poorly mismanaged its not even funny Ive never seen anything like this Next time mail the badges out Twitch  Edit: just heard that the line on the second block actually now goes all the way down to an alley underneath and overpass an then comes back https:imgurcomaeYutcpS  Edit 2: from uTheRealXmo here is a picture of the alleyway the line wrapped through under the overpass smh https:imgurcomaZVLoor3  Edit 3: So essentially when you consider how far the line went before wrapping back around and coming back you can easily say the line was well over a mile 16km long
135,Im a really new streamer but I ALWAYS have a couple people who tune in no matter what or where they are They just love hanging out in my stream It means so much to me every day one of my viewers runs home from class to come watch and talk with me I dont really know how to explain it other than it makes me want to stream for more than I can I streamed to no one for a bit but then a couple people stumbled across my channel and never left Super awesome makes me feel great knowing I am the reason theyre having fun
136,Killing Net Neutrality can and will most likely impact US streamers and viewers as well as foreign streamers with US audiences Internet Service Providers will have the authority to implement anticonsumer policies and as history has shown us will indeed put them into action  Perhaps Verizon will look at gigabits of data that Twitch viewers in the US alone are using per second to watch their favorite streamers and decide to throttle that? Maybe Comcast has an issue with Amazons who owns Twitch strong presence and dominance in the cloud and decides to limit its customers access to what they can and cannot access on Amazons network  These are all very real possibilities  If you dont want to skip a stream then try and participate and show your support in some other way And whether you decide to participate or not please realize how important this is How fundamental to the future of the internet this really is  Helpful Resources   https:wwwbattleforthenetcom  https:wwwbattleforthenetcomjuly12  https:wwwfightforthefutureorgnews20170707largestwebsitesonearthpreparefornet  Edit: Other ways you can help  Im surprised at the mostly positive reaction this is getting Im also very appreciative of the suggestions mentioned by users Because a lot of you are wondering about other ways to participate Ill go over a few ways that you can:    Instead of not streaming consider decreasing the bitrate and resolution at which you normally would stream This was a great idea brought to my attention by uLigerXT5 This would closely mimic what a Twitch viewer would experience if an ISP were to enforce limits   Spread this post to those you know that are fans of Twitch its platform and its community   Talk about it on stream and explain it to your viewers Provide them links and information and tell them how it could affect their ability to watch you as a content provider  streamer   Powered by battleforthenetcom you can optin to tweet urgent messages at key moments toward the build up to July 12th via [this link]https:wwwbattleforthenetcom?twitter_modal=1   If you run a website there is an opensource widget that displays an alert on the day of action not before to your visitors and presents them an easy to fill out form That can be found on this [GitHub repo]https:githubcomfightforthefuturebattleforthenetwidget   For those of you producing video content also provided by battleforthenetcom is a short video clip that you can include in your videos and possibly periodically during streams that can be found [here]https:drivegooglecomdrivefolders0B7iKho2OIeVzY1FKTlAzS1NOVTg   A comprehensive hive of documentation graphics copypaste messages and other resources can be found [here]https:docsgooglecomdocumentd1Z3wUF8CCs1g65dmnlxPCmy84WxCTpkzhLENULwubnoIedit It includes how to post about it on Facebook blog about it and email about it  And some more articles of interest:   https:wwwthevergecom20177615930170youtubestarsnetneutralityletterfcc  http:wwwmercurynewscom20170706techcompaniestojoindayofactionprotesttoprotectnetneutrality  https:motherboardvicecomen_usarticle8xa84kspotifygoogletonsofothercompanieswillprotesttosavenewneutrality

138,I used to be a regular contributor here but for several reasons I just dropped out completely and have not visited for well over a year Recently however morbid curiosity drove me to take another peek during which time I responded to [this post]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments4sm7fpbrace_yourselves  Ive been lurking during the intervening weeks since I made that comment and what Ive seen has only confirmed my belief that trying to help people here is a waste of my time Nonetheless a person that replied to my above comment seemed really nice and asked me to reconsider offering help to others I carefully considered this request and after a lot of thought and a lot of typing as you are about to see I decided that there were a few things I wanted to unload before I moved on                                   Dear Why am I not getting any viewers? Broadcasters  PSA: If youre not interested in growth on Twitchtv you can stop reading right now  Who I am is not important; Im not here to promote my own channel It will have to suffice to say that Ive been streaming on Twitch for a few years and have had what I consider to be a good amount of success on Twitchtv enough so that it is currently my fulltime job Im not special in any way; I just have a different perspective on things based upon a good amount of experience  What Im about to tell you is not going to be sugarcoated in any way People here that try to give others good critical feedback are often downvoted because well this is Reddit and most of those posts asking about how to increase viewership are made by people who think theyre special snowflakes and that there must be something wrong with everyone else because nobody is watching them But theyre not special and theyre not going to progress until they come to that realization This is just the way it is and if it hurts someones feelings I dont care Lets get started  You are not entitled to anything  We all see these posts on a daily basis usually more than once on the same page Hey Ive been streaming for XX weeksmonths now why isnt anybody watching me? My friends say Im funny and outgoing but nobody is tuning in Whats wrong??? WHY DOESNT ANYONE SUPPORT THE SMALLER CHANNELS LIKE MINE????  Whats wrong is that the people making those posts have a sense of entitlement; they believe that hey because theyre streaming people should be watching and thats as far as their train of thought goes They believe that out of the 14 MILLION broadcasters on Twitchtv a number that is somewhat suspect to me somehow some way theyre deserving of more attention than those other 14 million people And that is complete and utter bullshit  Theyre not special Youre not special either I sure as hell aint special There are many reasons that people who have built up a following on Twitch have succeeded but the biggest reason is that they worked hard for it often for several years They didnt expect people to watchthey worked their asses off so that people had a reason to watch in the first place  But playing videos games is fun and easy Why would you need to work at it? Because you knuckleheads when youre streaming youre doing more than playing games or cooking or painting or eating food or whatever else Twitch allows these daysif you are expecting people to watch you then you are saying to the world I am an entertainer And that brings us to the next point  If youre an entertainer then BE ENTERTAINING  Remember those posts I mentioned a moment ago by the people who wonder why nobody watches them when theyre so obviously passionate about video games and absolutely hilarious? One day I decided to follow up on three such posts just to see how amazingly entertaining these people supposedly were I have a stopwatchtimer built into my keyboard and as soon as I joined those channels I started the timer  Every single one of those broadcasters was either completely silent or almost completely silent for 10 minutes Imagine this scenario:  My favorite comedian is performing in my city and I shell out 50 to go see him I take my seat and after a few minutes the house lights go down and the audience starts cheering Then the spotlight hits Stage Left and out walks well lets say its Jim Gaffigan because I really like that guy So Jim walks to center stage and he waves to everyone and after a moment the crowd quiets down and gets ready for Jim to do his thing  But Jim just stands there doing nothing Or maybe hes looking around and waving to people but hes not saying anything Maybe he even does a little softshoe shuffle and that might elicit a few chuckles from the crowd but still other than that Jim isnt saying anything I think its safe to say that most of the people in the audience that shelled out 50 to listen to Jim would be very disappointed if for 10 minutes Jim didnt say anything funny  If you havent figured it out by now youre Jim Maybe comedy isnt your strong point and it doesnt have to be but if you expect people to watch you you have to keep them entertained Twitch is an interactive entertainment medium which is something that seems to go over the head of so many people People dont tune in to hear you say something every 10 minutes or every 5 minutes or once every minute Unless theres a cutscene in the game and youre being quiet so that your viewers can hear that dialog you need to be doing something to engage your viewers at all times But Jesus Christ thats sounds like such hard work I dont know what I should be saying or doing What should I be saying or doing??  By golly yes it is hard work Do you think Jim goes out on stage every night not knowing what hes going to say? Dont you think its plausible that at some point he sat down and at least outlined the topics he was going to talk about? And seeing as how timing is an important part of comedy he likely took some time to practice the delivery of his content as well dontcha think? Thats what is known as a work ethic So if youre wondering what you should be saying or doing to keep viewers engaged dont look to me or anyone else for answers because its your fucking job to figure that out Its your channel and you are solely responsible for your content Even if Jim had a staff of writers creating his standup routine for him and he doesnt he would still need to work to make it entertaining when hes out there on that stage  Were talking about live content here You dont get the chance to edit and fix things in postproduction like you would with a YouTube video You have to be energized and engaging the entire time that youre broadcasting because the moment you stop putting in that effort is the moment youre showing people the door and asking them to find something better to watch Do you think it takes hard work just to get people to find your channel? I would agree that yes its hard work but not nearly as hard as the work youll need to put in to keep them there You can get raided every day by the biggest streamers on Twitch and during those raids your follower numbers will shoot up because thats what happens during raids And then when those raids are over youll go back to your low viewer count because youre not putting forth the effort to keep people engaged  Stop asking others how you can come out of your shell and be entertaining; stop asking others what games you should be playing; take some time to do a Google search to figure out how shit like OBS works instead of asking others to hold your hand and do it for you Stop asking others to do your job for you Grow a pair and take complete responsibility for your content You can take all of the credit if you succeed but you also need to be prepared to take the blame when you fail  Theres no such thing as being fake if youre being entertaining  Going back to Jim as an example you dont actually believe that all of the things that most comedians say on stage are true do you? Sure many of their routines are based upon reallife situations but many scenarios are just flatout fabrications and were OK with that as long as that shit is funny right?  Yet people here complain and worry about how they are going to be perceived by their audience People here call out others for being fake for any number of reasons Tell those people to fuck off because again in case you missed it earlier its your channel If you want to be yourself be yourself If you want to express yourself with a sock puppet do that If you want to be a character from your favorite anime or something otherwise completely made up just do it You dont even need to do anything unique which is something you see people here frequently offer as advice; you just need to do whatever youre doing better than most people here which is not that hard at all given the very low bar for content quality on Twitch There are several good reasons why people with no viewers consistently sit at the bottom of the viewer counts and most of those reasons boil down to a lack of effort Putting forth more effort than they do will help you to rise above the bottom of that shitpile  When youre live you need to be the best version of you that you can be For some of you charismatic talkative outgoing people out there being yourself is just fine For the rest of you youre going to have to work at it How you ask? Again thats your job to figure that out and if you know what it is that you really want to do dont let others dissuade you from doing it ToS violations notwithstanding  Calling out someone for being fake is no different than complaining that the scenarios portrayed in your favorite TV show or movie are not very realistic because hey no shit its entertainment Even if every day of your real life is just like a new episode of Friends sometimes youll still want something different something more fantasy than reality because otherwise real life is all we would ask for  But I AM talented and entertaining I swear Everyone says so  Good for you Thats awesome Heres something to help you gain some perspective:  For every person you see on the big screen in the movie theater there are hundreds if not thousands more wouldbe actors who are equally talented that are still waiting for their big break while they bus tables at some holeinthewall Los Angeles caf Even with all of that talent they still have to work hard to get noticed and most of them will never make it to that big screen Yes even with all of that hard work there can still be some luck involved and not everyone sees their big dreams come to fruition  Of course the above scenario is only applicable if you have something of value to offer and the unfortunate truth for many of you is that you just dont have what it takes even though you may think you do The things you do among your small circle of friends might make them laugh but it may not play well to a larger audience Thats the true test; the laughs or approval you get from people you know may come because they know you and are comfortable around you but when youre in front of a crowd of strangers the reactions you get can be brutally honest Having no viewers for a long period of time is the most brutally honest feedback you can get Its a message with a degree of clarity to which no feedback in this forum can compare  If you can objectively say that youve put everything you have into broadcasting for a year and youre still not getting any viewers then youre not going to progress without making some drastic changes because what youve been doing just isnt working  Life if not fair; neither is Twitch And no one is stealing your viewers Get over it  Almost every page on this subreddit has a post by someone complaining about some broadcaster on Twitch Shes barely wearing anything Hes only getting viewers because of a gimmick Theyre only popular because they got raided by [insert big streamer name here]  Some people usually other broadcasters also believe that broadcasters that fit the examples given above are stealing views from legit streamers And if youre one of those people with such beliefs fuck you because youre a complete idiot  So you think you might have more viewers if Twitch permabanned xXBigBoobsBarbie69Xx? Really? Then let me ask you this: what does your channel have in common with hers? Youll probably answer Nothing I am SO much better than her OK then if your channel has nothing in common with hers then why the fuck would any of her viewers suddenly flock to your channel if she were banned? If she gets banned her viewers are going to find someone else providing similar content because thats what they want to watch And because you were so busy complaining you probably didnt notice that she has some highquality overlays along with aboveaverage audiovideo quality meaning that she knows something about production values She probably knows more about what it takes to keep people entertained than you ever will  No one has the right to dictate what others can or should watch on Twitch People are going to watch whatever they want to watch regardless of how you might try to influence them And consider this: have you ever heard the phrase theres no such thing as bad publicity? That holds true for content on Twitch; every time you complain about someone and call them out and try to convince people not to watch them you are effectively advertising their channel People are going to go watch them just to see what all of the fuss is about and guess what? Some of those people might actually stick around They might become regular viewers They might subscribe to that channel if applicable andor tip that broadcaster So good job Youre actually promoting the very content you despise because as I pointed out earlier youre a complete fucking idiot  Its also true that some people can get away with crazy shit on Twitch while others might get banned just for looking at the camera crosseyed And yes thats not fair Its true that Twitch plays favorites In that sense Twitch is a microcosm of real life and complaining about it isnt going to change anything Go ahead and report a channel if you truly believe that the broadcaster in question is committing an egregious offense that violates the terms of service But if youve filed several reports on that person and Twitch hasnt done anything then you can rest assured Twitch is generally OK with what that person is doing At that point your time might be better spent finding channels that you enjoy watching instead of continually complaining about something you dont like If youre a broadcaster that time would certainly be better spent making improvements to your own content I know that sounds like superobvious advice from Mr SuperObvious Guy but it apparently needs to be stated because we see these posts every day  Some people in this subreddit have no idea what they are talking about  As streaming becomes more accessible more and more people are going to start streaming and that means a substantial percentage of the content you see here is going to come from people that dont have a lot of experience Its great that people want to share what they know; unfortunately some people dont know jackshit  One of my recent favorite examples is about what nonpartners can and cant do This one is from the Twitch Bible Bannable Offenses Chapter 3 Verse 12:  And the Supreme N00b Broadcaster sayeth Verily I say unto you nonpartners must not stream above 30fps It is an abomination and upon you shall a pox be cast and you shall be cast out of the Twitch Garden if you try to stream at 60fps  Which of course is complete bullshit because the aforementioned Twitch Bible doesnt exist nor does any rule exist preventing nonpartners from streaming at 60fps Yet people spout this stuff as if some deity from on high relayed this information via a burning bush and carved some words into stone tablets promising to smite anyone violating said nonexistent rule  Theres also a deluge of advice from people that have been streaming for one week and finally got their first follower and in a rush of excitement decided to share their formula for success with all of the other new broadcasters From my perspective most of these posts are thinly veiled channel advertisements but even if the poster has nothing but the best intentions the advice is at best something that has been regurgitated hundreds of times There are often things mentioned that could have potentially negative consequences because as the header for this section mentions these people have no real experience to draw upon Im talking about ideas or incorrect information such as followforfollow schemes; shoutout for shoutout schemes; get a bigger channel to raid you schemes which would require a topic of its own to explain; tips arent taxable posts which might be true in some places but KNOW FOR CERTAIN that its applicable to someone asking about it; and whoknowswhatelse  Im not saying moderators should censor these posts; Im saying that the people making these posts should be censoring themselves because they dont know what theyre talking about Consider the following: you have a problem with your car; its not running properly and you dont know enough about cars to fix it yourself Ithe person writing this postalso know practically nothing about fixing motor vehicles I can however change my own oil; Ive done it countless times over the years Would you trust me to fix your car just because I know how to change the oil? I hope not because I sure as hell wouldnt Such advice is probably better saved for use as wordsofencouragement such as a simple yeah I had no viewers for a long time but I kept at it worked on my content and now I have fun people to hang with when I stream  Having the enthusiasm and desire to help other people is great; having the knowledge and experience to make that offer meaningful is also important otherwise that offer may not be helpful at all  Theres so much more to say but very few people made it this far  And thats OK As I stated some 3000 words ago I just needed to get this out there and I figured that this was the best way to say it because this same information doesnt seem to be sinking in when people try to present it in a nice politicallycorrect format and there are only a handful of contributors that even bother to be honest in the first place The majority of what goes on here is just one big circlejerk  Upvote or downvote as you wish; this will disappear into the past in a few days and in the end nothing will have changed Perhaps one person will benefit from this while its still visible and if so youre welcome Otherwise my time is best spent working on my own content because I actually care about the value and quality of my broadcast for my own sake and for the sake of my viewers 
139,Where exactly does this stop?   Why are we not looking at this particular emote for face value like we are with TriHard for example Im aware that its in the ToS about avoiding emotes of other streamers but this emote wasnt even of another streamer Its just the owner of the channel with sunglasses and a mustache At what point do we now draw the line on likeness of another streamer?  This opens up yet another thread of unclear ToS and action is being taken before measures are even in place
140,Im the type of person who stops by your stream and doesnt chat  Its not because you arent entertaining enough you are thats why I stopped by  Im just there to watchlisten to you   Sometime I just leave your window open in the background while I work on something else  Ive replaced binge watching Netflix in favour of you    Dont get discouraged by people like me  you are doing an amazing job  Like a talk radio station during a morning commute you keep me company   Im just not the type to call in   Keep up the good work guys  Keep streaming  The viewer count and chat isnt as important as you think  consistency is  Be there for people like me  Dont ever stop    Thank you for entertaining me  
141,https:twittercomTotalbiscuitstatus690967487618359296  Can we have a discussion on this point? Banning games seems hugely inconsistent on Twitch at the moment Itd be nice to have a reason attached to each of the banned games to explain why the game specifically was banned With the number of banned games at the moment this would be very easy to implement and in the future keep on top of as more games are added  I also dont think Twitch should blindly adhere to the ESRB ratings Such as when banning Hatred as companies can influence the ESRB far more than an indie dev who may get bad press and lower game exposure due to an overblown controversy for example  Remaining opaque on the reasons for banned games being on the list also opens the door wide up for Twitch to be pressured into allowingdisallowing certain games in the future by competing games companies Being transparent would avoid this possibility  Discuss?  Edit: Itd be nice to have some Staff members chime in if they think more transparency is a bad thing

144,My intention for this post is not to be rude but rather to be realistic Disclaimer: This post is not aimed at people who stream as a hobby or just for fun Its aimed at users who are upset and confused as to why their dream to be a professional streamer is failing   Streaming is hard and its not for everyone   I wade through posts featuring users expressing injustice and disdain because they havent made it big in their streaming career I sift through threads containing lazy hardware and technical questions from users who want everything spoon fed to them If you are unwilling to do your own research And a lot of it at that then streaming probably isnt for you If you are unwilling to put in months upon months of hard work then streaming probably isnt for you If you cannot handle biting remarks from trolls It will happen then streaming probably isnt for you   Streaming is tough I get it But dont blame your shortcomings on others Eg I cant be successful because Im not a girl who flashes their tits If you truly want to be a full time streamer be prepared to work hard for a long time Many will try few will have what it takes to succeed Work hard for what you want    Edit: I did not expect so much feedback on this post and I appreciate everyones responses I want to be clear on the fact that this post is aimed towards people who are aiming to become full time streamers and NOT people who stream as a hobby If streaming is a hobby for you this post does not apply  I also want to clarify what I  meant when I mentioned lazy technical questions This sub is an excellent place to find information and ask more specific techhardware questions that might not have a lot of documentation available already I am referring to the repetitive low effort easily searchable questions that we see on this sub incredibly often While theres nothing inherently wrong in asking; my point was that being unwilling to make the quick google search often demonstrates a lack of personal drive and ability to troubleshoot    Lastly I want everyone to recognize that this post is adressing streaming from a strictly business approach Its harsh advice and some of my responses have been deemed abrasive Starting a business is difficult and if you want your business to survive; you cannot blame your shortcomings on external factors and expect pity and help Approach streaming as a legitimate business and find creative and professional solutions to your problems

147,This horror story begins with me trying to claim Prime rewards which all ended up in failure except apparently the PUBG crate  So me: Something is probably wrong with my account  When trying to get the PUBG crate somehow my Prime sub migrated from Prime Video to Amazon Prime  No problem I thought Hit the Claim offer button Offer unavailable  So me: Something is definitely messed up Lets try this thing from scratch  That was possibly one of the worst decisions I made this year  But anyway  I unlinked my Amazon and Twitch Prime account from the connections  settings then went back to [twitchtvprime]https:twitchtvprime  Waited for a while to let it enable the Prime features again and then  We cant enable Twitch Prime on your account  Wait what?  Checked everything checked everything again Everything seems right  Then contacted Amazon Support Completely unhelpful Said I needed for the Prime trial to end Kept saying that while I 100 KNOW that Twitch Prime worked the last time from day 1 I even said that to the Amazon CS person Didnt or didnt want to understand this  So now it seems I can forget about the Prime offers because the onboarding service doesnt work and nobody apparently can help or fix it Great  If anyone from the Twitch Prime team reads this: Please take a look at your service Something is definitely not OK
148,This subreddit is filled to the brim with good nuggets of info about the technical and social aspects of streaming but I feel like I never see much discussion about your most important asset in entertainment: your voice With some very small exceptions every successful streamer has their voice prominently featured in what they do Its an instrument that we all use to entertain those who watch us Lets make sure were using them right and keep them in top shape  As a bit of background Im a variety streamer that focuses on games I can do voices for When Im not streaming Im an amateur voice actor host and educator which keeps my voice busy Ive taken lessons from 3 different voice coaches of which Im borrowing from heavily to make this post Im no expert but hopefully this is a good starting point  Streaming is a harsh thing to do to a voice Depending on the streamer youre placing strain on your vocal chords for several hours a day with little rest For those not used to speaking a ton this can be devastating to your overall sound Here are some tips on how to keep your voice safe and strong before and during your stream  Before you stream:   Hydrate hydrate hydrate Keep that water flowing Keeping your system hydrated is going to keep your vocal folds in top elastic shape which helps them stay cleansounding and resilient in your streaming barrage   Get some rest Part of keeping your voice healthy is keeping you healthy Get the sleep you need and if you know youre going to be pushing it sometime soon try to keep your voice quiet as much as possible beforehand Take that prestream car karaoke down a notch and save it for the mic Same goes if you get sick or your voice gets hoarse No need to cause lasting damage for some short term gain   Think about what youre taking into your body Smoking is obviously a big no if you want to keep those chords healthy Secondhand smoke and other lung irritants can be harmful as well so try to keep away from heavyduty smoking sectionspoorlyventilated smokehousesdepartment store perfume samplers What you eat and drink can affect your sound as well Certain products like dairy and artificial sweeteners can cause a buildup of mucus which tends to generate lots of mouth sounds unintentional usually wetsounding noises easily caught by mics that no one save certain ASMR fans wants to hear Same goes for spicy foods and carbonated drinks which can cause acid reflux and just generally awful feelings while speaking Honey is a timehonored folk remedy that tends to help coat your throat and soothe any sore feeling Mix it in some tea and have a lovely tea time before stream   Warm up and stretch One of the coaches I worked with has an [awesome set of stretches and workouts]https:wwwvoicescomblogtommy_griffiths_5minute_workout_for_voice_actors that really prepares your facemouthvoice for speaking Youll look like an absolute lunatic performing these but I promise that it really does help Heres the gist of it:  > For about 1 minute: > > Grin as hard has you can and hold it for a few seconds then quickly purse your lips and hold Do this back and forth a few times then quickly stick your tongue out Stretch it as far as it will go Then touch the back of your upper teeth with the tip of your tongue Hold for 5 seconds > Say the word wow Notice the positions of your mouth when you say the word?

151,Hello everyone  I have made a guide for my budget streamer buddies and wanted to share this with you all I apologize in advance if any rules are broken I did read them carefully before finally deciding to submit  The Elgato Stream Deck is a wonderful piece of hardware but it is a little steep in price for the average streamer This alternative uses your mobile device such as a spare phone or tablet to use like a stream deck  The software used in this guide is completely free and available to everyone to use  https:imgurcomahUgzk  Forgot to mention a couple things in the video itself  1 The Roccat Power Grid software runs on your local network and nowhere else This provides a secure connection without any 3rd party servers Of course if your internet drops off then so does the connection At that point however your stream probably went down also Kappa  2 You can also launch websites and hotkeys for applications like Adobe products etc  Thanks for watching  https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=WfIQN9_PxRM  Disclaimer: I am by no means associated with Roccat or any of their services I just wanted an alternative to the Elgato Stream Deck and after weeks of searching and testing I found something close enough  Edit: a word  Edit 2: By usercolour_golden Worth pointing out this isnt gonna work if your on iOS11 The app hasnt been updated since iOS6 and wont install on iOS11
152,The line to get my badge took 3 hours The line to get inside took 30 minutes after that Once inside I got in the line for the store and spent another 2 hours there I didnt get to see any of the presentations I wanted to see and missed out on meeting half the people I wanted to I was only able to make it for Friday If I do this again next year I need to go a day early just to get the badge
153,Theyre AND filters not OR filters I mean seriously how out of touch can you even be?
154,so Im thanking you all instead  I dont typically care for the thanks for supporting small streamers spam posts that routinely pop up around here but obviously Ive turned into a hypocrite in a sense  I blindly streamed a new to me game tonight without having ever seen it played before Just a couple of minutes in I was getting flustered and internally panicking and considering switching games because I didnt even know how to use the controls A complete stranger appeared in my chat no idea where they came from and started guiding me through setting up the game and explaining how things worked and what I needed to know One of my mods sent me a text asking if I knew who the person was no idea They stuck around for an entire hour of my stream giving me tips and guiding me through figuring out the game since I was overwhelmed   Obviously Im not expecting that person to see this but Ive been on a poststream high for 3 hours now just because I felt supported and that Twitch wasnt such a scary place tonight after all Ive gotten used to trolls coming into my chat but I was so shocked at someone just genuinely wanting to help and hang out without asking creepy personal questions or making crude comments let alone without ridiculing me at all for not knowing how to quit to the main menu of a game I had this newfound confidence for the rest of my night that maybe Im not so bad at this after all since someone came and hung out with me and didnt seem to be bored away   Since I cant thank that person directly I wanted to thank this community Streaming is such a fun thing that I started  doing to hang out with friends and didnt expect to love but the support thats out there is overwhelming if you look in the right places even though the whole scene seems impossibly huge at first Im coming home at night excited to stream and getting excited with my mods over being able to stream and I never ever expected to develop such a passion for something like this So thank you 
155,Its getting ridiculous   https:wwwredditcomrGlobalOffensivecomments4optg2moe_csgo_diamonds_and_twitchs_no_reaction
156,Just curious what peoples opinions are on this I know they vary from person to person   EDIT : I just want to say thank you to all the replies I cant respond to them all but Ive read them all 
157,I can be okay with the new channel list but having to load more to be able to reach the only streamer im subscribed to is kind of annoying What do you guys think?
158,I have done this for a good 34 years now and honestly its been very positive on the streamer and the chat also Ive found some great small communitys and watching them grow is great  I always try and find someone whos got 40ish views due to its just easier to interact  Why do I do this? Just to spread positivity during Christmas time and make someones day : 
159,I think it would be really nice if we counted the total number of months subscribed rather than consecutive months in determining subscriber loyalty Some of us subscribers are sometimes forced to suspend our subscriptions because of unforeseen reallife financial problems which causes us to lose our subscription streak When we finally resubscribe our loyalty badge is unfortunately kicked down to entrylevel because our subscription counter is reset to 0 I know that this was never Twitchs intention but its slightly discouraging for those of us who have been otherwise loyal subscribers until life decided to kick us in the balls and have tried our best to overcome those obstacles to continue our subscriptions and support our favourite streamers  FeelsBadMan  Please Twitch masters please?
160,Hello   I am writing this anonymously to shine light on a funnyhorriblesad issue that exists on Twitch I am the boyfriend of a streamer I am not allowed to show myself on her stream or make any noise when she streams Because then she thinks her viewers would realize that she has a boyfriend and leave the stream Her subscribers would unsubscribe and people would stop donating We even put up two huge matresses to try and prevent any noise from penetrating the walls from when I play video games in the room nearby She doesnt mention me at parties because she thinks that guys wont talk to her if they know that she has a boyfriend We split up at parties and go by ourselves because of this reason   I am pretty sure a lot of streamers do the same only that we dont know about this because were not supposed to know about it Its kind of horrible when you think of it that you have to hide your boyfriend in order to maintain the income from your stream   If anyone has any stories to share feel free to do so please do not point fingers though Keep it anonymous I want to hear your opinions  UPDATE: Oh my god I did not expect this to blow up like this Thank you everyone for the replies The people who are saying this is fake I dont really care if you believe this or not I am not going to provide evidence that could start a witch hunt   I appreciate all your answers we had a serious talk where we kind of broke up but then she realized what she was doing wasnt really okay so she said sorry 100x times and said I can be on her stream and she mentions me sometimes when people talk about me People know I live with her and they seem to like me actually I think this will turn out for the better Thank you to all the answers it was great sparking a discussion like this 353 comments and 16 000 views on this thread is insane I was expecting maybe 10 comments maximum   Its great that we can talk about these issues without generalizing girl streamers or we on Twitch That was really not my intention with what I wrote  Thank you for the replies again and I hope the conversations in this thread was helpful for other people going through the same issue as I was  Kind Regards  Anonymous
161,Not sure if this is well known but I figured I would post this seeing as I havent heard of it until recently needed to test settings due to having trouble with my internet connection   If youd like to test your settings and connection to the twitch servers for your stream but dont want to go live in order to do it just add this directly after your stream key in OBS or other similar programs:  ?bandwidthtest=true  You can now press start stream and you will send data to the twitch servers without actually going live   You can also go to this web address to see a comprehensive readout of your connection in real time and get tips on troubleshooting issues    https:inspectortwitchtv   You must be logged in to see the data while you are live   
162,You can read about the settlement here: http:wwwpcgamercomtwitchviewbotmakersorderedtopaynearly14millioninlawsuitloss  This case has been ongoing for about a year and a half I personally havent seen many obviously viewbotted streams in a while I assume because of the ongoing litigation This lawsuit outcome will most likely only help keep these events to a minimum
163,The blue number directly above his camera is his sub count
164,So I was just finishing up one of my streams for the night and one of the last comments in chat is by one of my regulars He says Hey Demonic can you check Discord when youre done? I didnt think much of it and checked This is what was written for me:  nbsp;  Demo dude Ive been watching your streams for a long time now and enjoy them a bunch Playing with A B and C took out the names and the community is hilarious I have a lot of anxiety issues around talking and using voice chat online why I didnt talk in ARMA COMMUNITY NAME  or to you for ages until i built up confidence pretty much because Im fucking 15 and my voice hasnt broken yet but Im just so thankful you havent taken the piss or anything anyway I dont know where Im going with this but thanks a bunch mate And i 100 understand if you dont want to play or stream with me in it         This was probably the weirdest para Ive ever sent but felt like I needed to get things off my chest  Thanks for being a great streamer   I know its awkward so you dont have to say anything tbh As long a you understand  nbsp;  I was quite taken back by the message as I never expected to get anything like this It was a really heartwarming thing to read Ive heard stories or seen clips about how a fan of a streamer says how much the streamers content means to them but I always thought that is something that only happens to the bigger streamers  I could relate to the message as well I never used voice at that age in online games in fear of being taken the piss out of and Im happy he managed to build up his confidence in the end  I dont know if this is an appropriate post for the subreddit I thought it was just nice to show how streaming can have such an impact and positive effect on both the viewer and the streamer
165,Just had an email from Twitch with some pretty neat news for affiliates  Whats changing?

166,As a smaller streamer Ive always been curious on what kind of things to do to prevent people from disliking my stream Do you hate when smaller streamers have a donation button? Or are they not talking enough? Let me know because I really want to improve my streams :D
167,That is absolutely insane He had only 100K subs 17 days ago
168,Hey guys   I am a 15 yo streamer who recently reached affiliate on twitch I need some advice however as my mom wont give me my social security number that I need in order to fill out the tax interviews because she thinks I will have to pay taxes and is very stubborn about this What can I do to change her mind as I would really like to have an emote and sub button  EDIT: I understand I will have to pay taxes if I make enough but only some of my income will actually be taxed My mom thinks I will be taxed more than I make and she is stubborn so its an issue  EDIT 2 : Hey guys I appreciate the support and advice given to me in this thread However at this point she doesnt want me streaming at all and she wants me to focus on my school and she is set on this mentality Although I disagree I do live under her roof so I will have to respect the rules she puts down although I was very excited about the quick growth of my stream probably due to a gimmick I was using Thanks again for the help and streaming will definitely be something I pick up again once I head to college 
169,So a quick story  So because I was attending University I couldnt spend time with my mom also because she lived in the US and me in Canada So every week or so we would call each other over Skype on my laptop and talk about how I was doing During these talks I would sometimes be playing games So this one time she asked to see what I was doing and luckily Skype had a share screen option so she could see my play Eternal and Democracy 3   So on my week off she asked if she could see one of my bigger games on my PS4 So I got her to set up Twitch and together she watched me play GTA V Fortnite and Gwent for a while She says my driving was terrible because I kept running red lights in GTA said that she liked how so many people missed me in the Bushes in Fortnite and how fast Gwent was She also laughed in Democracy 3 when my decision to put a 7537; tax on gas led to riots Warning me that she was surprised it didnt happen sooner while I had her connected on Skype It was a great time  So yeah thanks Twitch for allowing this to happen
170,Since I could not find any good tutorial on Voicemeeter I decided to create my own I hope this will help you guys improve your stream seeing as Voicemeeter has enormous potential to do just that If you got any questions or if anything was unclear in the video do not hesitate to comment and let me know Your feedback is also very much appreciated   Without further ado heres the guide: https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=sAa7v1PPlzg  EDIT: Check out uBOLL7708 post for some really great added information on Voicemeeter  EDIT 2: Thanks for the gold uVirtuteX
171,I feel like Ill come off as an asshole for all of this but trust me you have to be there putting up with him nonstop for a year to fully understand  I have this guy who has somehow never broke a rule yet ruined streaming for me He says the dumbest stuff has the most annoying requests and somehow has to turn every conversation into something about cars and parkour I dont understand those types of people who always turn a conversation into their hobby despite no one being interested Dude did you see that sick R150 Chrome blah blah blah? Isnt that sick? Whats your favourite model? no Ive told you how many times that I dont know anything about cars so please stop  Ive told him time and time again that I only turn song requests on for multiplayer games yet every single player one I play he has to at least say once in the chat sr? And then when I am playing a game with song request on he keeps asking for me to turn the music up so loud that you can barely hear me or my friends If he cares that much about music he should go listen to it on his own The songs he request are the EXACT same ones every time And guess whats in the title most of the times? Best songs to drift to Sometimes he doesnt even request music just the sounds of cars revving up Speaking of drifting he sure as hell lets everyone know about this 80 of my streams he leaves with Okay gonna go drifting now see ya  A huge chunk of my viewers have left because they cant stand him either Ive been told by many that he ruins the stream for them My friends have all been driven mad by him too and they arent even the ones who have to read his messages nonstop Theyve convinced me that he needs to be banned or something else needs to happen I just dont know how to do this without seeming like the biggest prick around I feel bad for him cause he clearly likes watching me but I cant just let him torment me nonstop  What should I do? And yes I have told him time and time again not to do most of these things but the problem is they arent really rules to begin with  EDIT: Thought I would give some more fun examples I used to watch a couple YouTube videos with him at the end of every stream but Ive since stopped Yet nearly every stream he still asks for me to watch a 10 minute video even though I dont do that anymore He even made a playlist called Videos for Johnny that he posts a link to in the chat every time The playlist is literally just full of racing and parkour  Yesterday he comes into the chat and says You guys see that new Jack Ryan show? The driving and parkour looks amazing The stunts are done by some YouTubers I know of I never even noticed driving or parkour in the trailer  He says some weird sexual shit too Ill go take a break and when I get back hell say something like I bet you just had sex ;  EDIT 2: [Heres a clip of what inspired this post today]https:clipstwitchtvViscousBoredCakeStinkyCheese My friend last night called out my viewer on all the bullshit hes done  EDIT 3: Should have mentioned that he was a mod lol I was really dumb before when streaming where I would mod any regulars who never broke rules and would enforce them Ive thankfully learned from this Also the drift king supreme is now banned from my Twitch  EDIT 4: I cant reply to everything but thank you all for the replies and help  EDIT 5: Thought of some more things hes done He back seat games whenever there is a driving part in a game I play Hell tell me how horrible I am at driving a certain way and that I need to do this thing that way Ive since made backseat gaming a rule because of him though it should have always been a thing Forza Horizon is one of my favourite games and yet I dreaded playing it this year because of all the bullshit he was gonna tell me about every single car I drove I feel relieved now that hes banned  He would try to find me on Facebook and asked me to spell out my last name even though I told him I wouldnt  When my friends call him out all he does is talk shit to them and doesnt listen to their criticism  Oh and heres some gold I should have mentioned in the original post He has changed his picture twice on Discord to a different car and every time asked us for our opinions on it and acts like his profile picture is badass First time it was Got them new Discord pic and the second it was Hey Crazy what do you think of my new profile picture? Its just a fucking car what is he expecting me to say????  You know reading all this really makes me feel crazy for not banning him sooner  EDIT 6: Worst part of it all is that Im pretty sure he infected me with police ligma  EDIT 7: Probably the last edit I sometimes mute the stream for a minute so my friends and I can talk about something private Despite the fact I say every single time first Okay muting the stream for a minute hell say in the chat Is something wrong? Im pretty sure your audio is gone 
172,Twitch is banning popular IRL streamers at a rapid rate Not to name names but unlike a previous ban which could be argued was brought upon the streamer by encouraging swatting the most recent ban of a popular IRL streamer makes zero sense
173,So I was chillin on the twitchverse and my favourite streamers were offline or just having lunch so as my wont I wondered off around the 0 village at the bottom of the page  Silent stream after silent stream passed by until I found a place where someone was talking This was good  Let me preface this by saying I tend to browse incognito not because I hate talking I just hate being called out k?  Anypoo Im sitting there watching and listening to a reasonable streamer try to stay alive when lo and behold another person enters the chat They say hi the streamer gets visibly excited to see another person and asks newperson about their day pretty standard fare Newperson replies and the chat goes on from there Im enjoying this a little more and Im just about to drop a follow and join the conversation when newperson starts to troll and troll hard  Ive been on the receiving end of this the chatter starts off as a human gains trust and builds confidence with you and then they kick you in the proverbials out of left field  The streamer just laughed it off bantered back assuming incorrectly that newperson was just joking but they were not Over the space of five minutes it just got worse and worse The streamer whether they were desperate confused or just naive I dont know they didnt do anything It was like they froze They carried on playing the game however they played like they didnt care they stopped commenting on the game and just verbally and mentally shut down The troll carried on with the insults and put downs  I whispered the streamer  you should really ban that troll the command is ban newperson I saw them read the message and I received a message back nah at least they get me up the list in viewers  I left  TL;DR: Just ban the bastards You will lose viewers and followers  if you have trolls that make you feel like shit People pick up if you are feeling like shit whether on cam or just voice 
174,Im a small streamer whod play Quiplash with friends before so i thought Why not stream it Things go well for awhile before I spike 1015 viewers They asked for my discord and joined it and spammed racist messages everywhere After I ended stream awhile later I did some research on some of the users Turns out theres a community of people that play Quiplash who have racist chats who spam the TriHard apparently use it instead of other racist words emotes on other peoples streams In my case a streamer w 1000 followers led the charge and he personally joined and spammed stuff like Mod me and Ill clear you of the NRs These guys stream and act against the racism in their chats on stream so they dont get reported then do this to others Someone in my chat made it seem like a regular thing to occur So if you plan on streaming Quiplash or other jackbox games be prepared especially if its your first time doing it I wanted to put something here in case you are a small streamer like me who considered doing this  1 Make sure to have a mod or two in stream with you  I was lucky I had a couple of guys join me Youll prob need some help banning and timing out these guys For a small stream it can be a lot especially if its your first time dealing with it like me Also dont add any new viewers as mod Its a part of their scheme to the raid so only mod any regular viewers or people you know   2 If they ask for any external server you have DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM  The second someone spams something racist then someone asks for a discord dont give it to them If you have the proper security for it then do it But they all joined and spammed on there They were smart in doing this since you cant report them at twitch for a discord issue turns out you can report twitch so dont delete your server like I did   3 If you plan on playing with viewers be prepared to kick  I didnt know until today that the newer version of Quiplash allows you to kick people so if you plan on streaming that try to get that version I dont know how the other games are but if you have someone being edgy in your game be prepared to kick them or restart a game Also you can turn on twitch login so you can spot viewers easier if they dont listen to your rules hit the cog on the top left on jackboxs site  4 Only give codes to people youre close with or to regulars Thanks to uTimeWaster91 for making me remember this I did this by whispering friends and regulars and hiding the screen Of course a random viewer is a lot more likely to ruin the stream than others    I know that very few people have even considered streaming these games but if I can even find one person that I can help thatd be cool It was my craziest stream I had to date and I hope to spread the word around If you are a stream looking to interact with viewers its a great way to do so Good luck to all  Edit Thereve been a lot of replies from people who know a lot more than me so if this concerns you scroll through em I also just wanted to acknowledge that this is a far bigger issue than these games I know a lot of twitch is like this and it is truly sad I did a vague search of the posts but didnt see much on these games but I was hoping this small list might prepare even 1 person : Also if these people raid your discord or whatever you do you can report them to discord or even twitch thanks uboothin with the new TOS so dont make my mistake and delete it Keep that evidence  final edit: I did more research and a lot of the games from the Jackbox party pack 3 and newer have streaming features like having twitch logon forced so you can see the usernames of your players Theres also other censorship settings that aid in helping Theyve actually made great strides in helping streamers so I applaud Jackbox but still keep everything else here in mind in case you get raided 
175,Just went into a stream and saw a popup advertising this  After all this new hype and controversy around gamblinglootboxes in the gaming community Twitch decides they should go ahead with this?   https:blogtwitchtvbringthezombieapocalypsetotwitch7a5bf4ecff42
176,1 Make a new command  2 Set the command name to one of the following or both: >im  >im  3 Set the command message as the following: >Nightbot: >>Hi eval decodeURIComponentquerystring query || decodeURIComponentquerystring user Im dad  >Streamlabs Chatbot: >> Hi msg Im dad  4 Everytime someone says something like im [text] the bot will respond with Hi [text] Im dad
177,As a streamer and viewer Ive always liked interacting with a channels chat Back in the day I used to hang out in AOL chatrooms and talk with random people for hours Ive noticed over the years watching Twitch that some people fall into certain characters in the chat Here are the ones that come up the most:  E D I T: Added more now up to 21 types of people   The Conversationalist Even with lulls in gameplay theyre still chatting it up with the streamer and viewers to keep the stream active and engaging Its less about the game and more about the interaction This is even more helpful when the streamer is really focused on the game but also wants the chat to keep going without  having to always be talking   The Hype WoMan They do all the extra work for you so you can focus on streaming The ones who spam emotes when someone subs or give an extra thanks for a new viewers follow This is someone who genuinely enjoys your content and wants to get the word out for others Theyll host you clip highlights retweet your tweets and more They make each person feel more welcomed and valued than the streamer already shows Such a small thing that really goes a long way to building a community   The Assistant Moderator They arent a mod but that doesnt stop them from monitoring the chat They call out trolls remind newcomers of the rules and even assist with commands Its especially great when they are on the same thought process as you: you dont have to say anything they already know what you are about to say and do   The Coach These viewers want to see you succeed They give you constructive criticism when others dont You dont know how many times when there was a technical issue for hours and finally when they stepped in they said hey your mic audio is really low or You might want to change the game directory youre still streaming in IRL WHY DIDNT ANYONE TELL ME THIS BEFORE? And they will also tell you things straight up Hey you really offended that person you should apologize They say the things no one else cares enough to say or too afraid to bring up   The Backseat Gamer So bad that you need to make a rule of it A backseat gamer can ruin an experience by spoiling key moments or constantly giving advice even though you made it clear youre not looking for any You sometimes leave multiplayer lobbies invite only because you know theyll only drop in and make the game less challenging or too challenging Backseat gamers usually mean well but at the expense of the streamers experience   The Creeper First its flattering especially if youre not used to being complimented on your appearance Next it gets unnecessary Then is becomes unwelcomed They talk about your genitalsprivates PM you about how much they adore you and stalk your social media Finally it starts to bother you enough that you have to consider banning them   The Secret Billionaire They donate to you almost every stream in large amounts that catches everyone off guard When someone donates or cheers this person always has to one up them with a larger amount A viewer bought a Tier 1 Sub? They buy a Tier 3 They love seeing the streamer in shock and their names on all the donationbits leaderboards Where do they get this money? Apparently thats none of yo business   The Shameless SelfPromoter There will be streamers who want to ride on your success by trying to befriend you but their real motive is so blatant They indirectly try to bring your viewers into their stream with such things as asking if they can post their channel in your chat asking for you to host them after your stream or the worst inchat offense: Bye Ill be streaming [insert game] in 5 minutes You should stop by Then after the stream they ask you Since I followed mind following back? ew   the Borderline Troll This is someone who comes into your stream to get a kick out of annoying the streamer andor chat They want to get a reaction but dont go as far as actually breaking the chat rules So its hard to deal with them since a timeout is only temporary and you dont want to babysit them with timeouts   the Attention Seeker This is someone who intentional or unintentional brings attention away from the stream and chat onto themselves They complain that they are having a rough day got dumped by their boyfriend or got into a car accident Some of which are blatantly made up to get sympathy from the streamer and chat And if they feel ignored they make sure everyone knows If the streamer skips their message in chat they complain or even lash out against the streamer   the SelfAppointed Mod This is someone who acts like a mod but the problem is: they dont know the streamers limits So they attack anyone in chat even with low level offenses and ask the streamer to ban them even though its not a banable offense And if the streamer disagrees they call out the streamer with showing favoritism   the Person who hates EVERYONE except you This is someone who gets along with the streamer and supports them but anyone in chat? Not so much They make rude comments start arguments and make a good portion of the chat feel not welcomed Maybe its jealously or maybe its not but whatever it is it makes both the streamer and chat uncomfortable especially if that person has been a long time friend   the Rogue Mod At first you trusted this mod to follow your rules but they end up ignoring it and controlling chat how they see fit: banning those who dont warrant a ban making up rules or other abuses of power The worst possible situation is this mod turning the other mods against you Once you demod them headaches only get bigger    the Lurker That one viewer that always seems to be in your stream but doesnt say a word You want to say Hi and thank them or returning but you know you shouldnt Then hours into your stream when you do something amazing they suddenly post a PogChamp Your heart secretly fills with enjoy whenever you get a reaction from a longtime lurker   The Interrupter Hey when I tried to stream last night it was laggy can you help me? Did you know your Discord room is having an issue? Like Seriously? Do we need to talk about this now while Im streaming? They come into your stream to talk about something completely off topic that usually ends up taking away from the stream They dont mean any harm but their questions can always wait til after the stream or in a whisper   The Hater A streamer who simply doesnt like you and doesnt want you to succeed They spread rumors about you and come into your stream to bash you Whats worse is that they are in the chat of other streams you watch and even harass you there Banning them only fuels their hatred towards you and will find other ways to attack you   The Drama QueenKing Easily offended and made upset Most streamers try to appease these people hoping they will stay but it ends up being a toxic relationship If triggered these drama QueensKings announce to the stream that Im unfollowing you because of how you treat me or Give me back my donation you didnt say thank you It gets to a point that you really dont care and prefer them leave for the sake of the stream   The Annoying lil Sibling Not blood related at all but sure acts like it These people always wants to play with you and get upset when you dont want to Always impatient when waiting their turn to play with you they spam your inbox with invites And if you dont close your lobby they instantly jump into your game without asking You fake happiness and force yourself to tolerate it to come off as nice but let out a sigh of relief once they leave your game   Those 2 People Always Flirting With Each Other Sexual innuendos inside jokes and more these viewers cant get enough of each other so can they please do it in private? While you and the rest of the chat focus on the game on screen they only focus on each other At first you laugh and think its cute then its sorta uncomfortable having to read the message to each other    That One Person Who Wants to Meet you IRL that you avoid Makes you reconsider announcing the city you live in or your travel plans Whenever they hear youll be at a convention they let you know where they are staying and they have an extra double bed Or they live in the same state or province as you and constantly think of plans to meet up The only issue is the feeling is not mutual and they cant take a hint it isnt   The Contestant Its not a coincidence this person only shows up for giveaways and contests They simply are following or lurking to accumulate points for a reward like a free game Sure they dont really hurt the stream in any way but with enough of these people in your stream it really makes you reconsider doing giveaways and if your stream can grow without it  Am I missing anyone else? What kind of characters have you had in your chat? Do Share and lets laugh and cry together
178,But i am a dude  How do you explain streaming to those who dont know?   I thought this topic might bring some entertaining stories like the one i will share with you now   Once upon a time while enjoying a dinner with the family the topic of Hobbies was brought up Immediately the cold sweats began pouring as i knew i would have to yet again explain to someone my recent escapades in the world of Twitch streaming Once my turn came around i did the usual dance of Its kind of like YouTube but live and the ever famous Yes people actually watch other people play video games live   While my younger siblings understood and were familiar with the platform my dad had a somewhat flabbergasted look on his 65 year old I just got my first smartphone face  After further explaining how the medium works Pops seemed satisfied with the answer and the night carried on   Fast forward to the next day while in hot pursuit of the nearest Burger King i received a phone call from my father who very obviously has something of severity to talk about   Dad than proceeded to explain to me how he doesnt think my newfound path as and i quote An internet porn man is the right choice and that while it is A relief that men can be cam girls too i should pursue other avenues  After almost taking out a somewhat obtuse woman at a bus stop with my truck from laughing so much I explained the situation to my embarrassed father and he now understands   I hope   How do you explain streaming to those who dont know?   
179,Its incredibly hard to have someone stay subscribed with only one emote imo 
180,So I was using the legacy twitch dashboard up until maybe a week ago There was a url that would force the old one Not only did I find it aesthetically more pleasing but I was able to zoom in a couple of times on my browser and the chat was the perfect size for me to clearly read it on my second monitor without assistance  With the new dashboard forced the chat takes up maybe half if that the size it used to Unless theres some way to stretch the chat across two tiles which would be nice But Im a tad less responsive to my chat which kinda sucks since I was hyped for the reduced stream delay making interacting so seamless  I have keratoconus which is a degradation of the shape of the cornea My case is fairly mild so I dont wear hard contacts for it which you normally would But I also dont wear glasses at my PC because I originally only wore them for long distance vision and my glasses are mainly still geared towards that But I have problems with contrast vision things are little less clear Especially since my 2nd monitor is on the side of the eye that has the condition presenting far more and I can get ghost images underneath stuff So having a wider chat that takes up more real estate on the screen is a lot easier on me  Im kind of hoping that someone at twitch with their ear to the ground can maybe just let me use the old tech again or maybe even take my idea to stretch the chat across another tile But thats probably a long shot at this point and Id be glad to hear any potential solutions that keep the ease and convenience of the dashboard format intact while providing better visual clarity for myself
181,Hey Everyone In a month or so I will have streamed for a total of two years Its been a ride with good times and bad times along the way Ive taken breaks that consisted of a day or as long as 6 months Heres some things Ive learnt during my time with some tips  tricks in there too  \\The Mistakes\\  Well start out with the most important segment in my opinion Ill speak about some of the mistakes I have made while streaming what I did to fix them and even speak about the ones I am yet to fix  BEING INCONSISTENT  Being consistent during streaming was something that I neglected for the first year or so of streaming This is still now a mistake I can make from time to time if I decide to miss a day To really build a community you must be consistent in your content creation this does not necessarily mean streaming every\^single\^day or playing the same game every day but your community should know when youre going live and what youre going to playI get around this now by posting a message every morning in my discord under announcements stating if Im streaming and my plans and also throwing a question to interact with my community  NOT NETWORKING  Up until recently I did not think networking and meeting other streamers was a necessity but be sure as hell that it is I spent the first year and a half with the same group of people I always had been with this was a mistake even if it was fun But I did not branch out at all even when the opportunity was right in front of my face Since starting networking on Twitter Facebook and Twitch as well I have seen at least a 3040 increase in my viewership and growthNetworking does not mean you have to constantly meet new people and constantly be scrolling social media but Ill talk more about this in its own segment below  NOT SPEAKING TO GAME DEVELOPERSCOMPANIES  Its been about a month since I started to seriously realise the potential of speaking to companies and developers To tell the truth for so long I was pretty scared to contact Developers and Companies about their games or products because I thought theyd throw me away due to being a relatively small channelBut after doing so I quickly realised that they would not see you as a joke And to be frank you dont know unless you try A quote I love regarding this point is that you miss all the shots you dont take Speak to PR companies speak to devs this is not about getting free stuff but instead adds further to your networking and could even help you build your community and give back to those who give so much time to you and your stream  KEEPING AROUND THE TOXIC VIEWERS BECAUSE THEY ARE AN ADDED VIEWER  Trust me its not worth keeping around toxic people who ruin the vibe of your stream I made this mistake and you lose more community members than you gain Yes they add a view to your stream But in the long run they will only bring more toxicity and Im sure many folks do not want this to represent their content and channel Think about the new guys coming across your channel what would they think? Im not saying kick them out but sometimes a warning can do wondersAt the end of the day community is the heart of twitch building one of your own is just as important as keeping your quality high  BURNOUT BAD BAD BAD  I made this mistake and it links back to point one The only person who causes a burnout from content creation is yourself Do not force yourself to stream every day if you dont want to stream that day dont do it Notify your gang and take the night off  These are not all the mistakes Ive made during my time on Twitch but they are some of them I really hope this helps some of you The next section here is a few Tips and Tricks to those of you just starting out or even the veterans out there  x200B;  x200B;  TIPS AND TRICKS  I will not pretend to know everything but heres a few short tips and tricks for the folks out there looking to stream or looking for a little motivation Much love If I missed anything let me know  QUALITY OVER QUANTITY \ Ive seen people stream 12 hours a day every day for months and see very little growth Truth is its not about streaming all day every day its more about having that quality that makes you stand out in the crowd and draws viewers in to your stream This can be your personality your game ability or even just the outright quality of the stream youre hostingRemember this is your channel and your content you make it how you want it Be proud of what youre doingI guess in short what Im saying is build something youre proud of If you stream for 3 hours a night and work on your stream for 2 hours afterwards thats better often than a 5 hour stream  USING SOCIAL MEDIA \ Use your social media I see so many new streamers just using their Twitter for posting when they are going live Dont do this follow other streamers on the platform chat with them post polls interact I must also add for Twitter dont overuse s  You may have heard about SupportSmallStreamers this may well have been a good hashtag back in the day but now its ravaged with bots and really gets you nothing but retweets that no one else will see A nice touch might be creating your own hashtag but also remember to tag the developer of the game youre playingOther social media platforms you should look at are Facebook and Steamgroups if you consider this SM they are equally important and steamgroups are highly useful for streaming and announcing things  NETWORKING \ I touched with this one before in the sections above but networking is necessary if you want to grow and more importantly meet new people Start Twitter conversations with streamers developers and viewers Create a discord server and chat with your viewers in there Become a viewer in other folks streams chat with them there too And of course playing with them on stream creating a podcast or simply hanging out with them can push you further  \If you have things to add let me know and Ill edit them in crediting you of course Thanks for reading If you saw this post before its because it was here before The mods had taken it down for reasons and have since allowed me to repost Thank you mods\
182,playing past broadcast is not live there is no interaction with viewers or anything   there are bilions of videos like that on youtube and also on twitch as vods   there is a huge and important difference between watching offline videos and LIVE videos
183,One of my favourite things to do on Twitch is to just go on random small Twitch streamers streams and have a nice little chat with them Talk about the game theyre playing cracking a couple of jokes its all just so wholesome when the streamers talk back and just makes my day
184,I am seeing this so often and its becoming a reoccurring pattern where people think its okay to do when its kinda not and falls under selfpromotion and reposting A lot of people are going to downvote me and dislike my opinion and thats fine because everyone is entitled to their own opinion   The way I see it is people post threads like first time streaming and it was awesome or my experience as a streamer for x amount of months and along those lines which all feature the same format where they talk about whatever and or try to throw a curb on it that may seem like its just a thread looking for feedback or sharing their experiences when theyre not really qualified to do so by any means but boil it down and its usually all for the same purpose which is to promote their channel in one way or another Im sure some will agree and others wont but its getting pretty stale seeing the same posts over and over again I can understand how people feel the need to talk about what excites them with their channel growth but I cant help but feel people just do it and think well maybe someone will like what I have to say and come to my channel which is real scummy by my standard  Maybe Im just taking an asinine approach to this and taking it the wrong way if I am I apologize if it offends anyone but thats just kinda how I see it  Also there is a vast infobase of everything you need to know if you just searched this subreddit or even google first before making a repost   Edit 1: Possible Resolution  Many have suggested a weekly biweekly or monthly expressive megathread would help deflate the amount of reposts people make in regards to these types of topics and I agree that its a fairly decent idea but it would have to be structured properly I am sure the mods are figuring this out that will work for everyone with minimal uproar That way everyone gets what they want with little to no sacrifice Or perhaps maybe just individuals like this can actually read the twitch subreddits rules and abide by them rather than trying to get past them and self advertise in any way that they can  Edit 2: Spotting the Difference              I feel like many people have touched base on this in regards to my post and theyll typically say well whats the point of rtwitch then? or something like that which is fair to say but kind of wrongly assessed from the entire point of this thread discussion My reply to them would be spotting the difference between someone who may be doing it to promote their channel and someone who is genuinely seeking advice on a matter that is important to them and others It varies from situation to situation and its really all about how its perceived At the end of the day I do not want to have others take away from these threads people make that are legitimate and constructive to the community after theyve done their researched both here and on google to avoid reposts To make a long story short its all about discretion and obvious selfpromoting which can usually be separated fairly easily from the actual posts of people seeking council   We all must also keep in mind that we are merely stating our opinions and thats all theyll ever be It is not right of us to forcefully shove those opinions onto others then disrespecting them for not agreeing with them We believe in freedom of speech so lets remember to allow everyone to exercise that right Be respectful Always  Reminder of Rule 3     > Channel promotion is no longer permitted as voted by this community This includes but is not limited to stream promotion including channel links in postscomments looking to collaborate and looking for feedback  Reminder of Rule 7     > Repetitive topics will be removed  you should use the search function before posting Repetitive topics covers anything that the community feels is posted too much This list can be updated without warning so make sure to check regularly  Additional Notes     > You have to understand the amount of reposts on this subreddit While I think its great that people want to share their experiences they also have to understand that their experiences have been said many times over before by others People need to learn how to search for things instead of just cluttering up this subreddit with repeated topics 
185,Torrent thanks to Aizome at rgamedev :  https:drivegooglecomopen?id=0B3re2AF_gdUhVHlFUDZhQnN4MFU  Soundclick:  http:wwwsoundclickcom_mobileFramecfm?bandID=1277008  My blog where I release the songs and FLstudio project files for them:  http:anttismusicblogspotfi  Some of the songs on the torrent get misidentified as band Tolgateers due to soundclick programming error for about two weeks in 2015 that set the ID3 information incorrectly to Tolgateers

190,For a quick snip if youre unaware of who I am Im Destiny one of the very first streamers on TwitchTV back then it was JustinTV and Ive been streaming for a living for the past 4 years    A lot of people get very upset at women who stream to show off cleavage that xxx girl streamer is a whore or men who stream using silly voices fuck xxx and his stupid voices or other gimmicks all xxxx does is give shit away all day and cry on stream omg  The business of streaming is absolutely fucking brutal It is the ultimate expression of free market combined with a healthy bit of cronyism going on as well There is no minimum wage there are no guaranteed hours and no one is going to help you figure out your now absurdly complicated taxes No one is going to help you with your marketing no one will tell you how to communicate effectively with business partners and no one will hand you sponsorships  Want a website? Figure it out yourself Want a custom subscription or donation system? Better know how to code or else find someone to pay to set it up for you Need artwork? I hope you can draw or I hope you have a strong fanbase who doesnt mind producing free content  Do you think theres some streamer thats absurdly popular only because hes part of an old boys club or because he just happens to a friend of a popular Youtube star or current Twitch streamer? Guess what youre probably right  The point Im trying to get across is that streaming nothing in life really is NOT a meritocracy You are not rewarded by some third party for hard work for keeping a schedule for staying moral for adhering to some tenets of being a good streamer or for any other kind of behavior At the end of the day it all comes down to how many warm bodies you can convince to watch your stream Thats the ultimate determinate of your paycheck  One of the most important steps to success that you can take is to realize that  in this wild west of streaming where the market is oversaturated as fuck and people who are putting dozens of hours a week in to stream while still barely managing to survive  everything is fair game and whether or not you want to judge someone for the way they market themselves it has no impact on your own performance  If I were a woman who looked good I would 100 consider taking advantage of my appearance for more viewers  Lets look at a couple basic facts that we can safely assume    The OVERWHELMING majority of viewers are male  Many of them are young  If you have two different streamers Samantha and Jessica and both of them were the exact same in regards to schedule quality of play quality of stream communication with audience and entertainment quality and one of them decided to show a little bit of extra cleavage or appear more physically attractive due to extra work on hairmakeupetc they would absolutely get more viewers  Again to stress streaming is not a meritocracy  To address a few side things that may come up    But youre cultivating a different kind of viewerbase if you market yourself based on your boobs  Yes and no Just because you appear attractive or market your physical features it doesnt make you a bimbo or an airhead You can use looks or any other gimmick to get people in the door; you keep them there by being entertaining A girl who markets her physical features but is otherwise vapidboring will not retain viewers Shell get a large surge in temporary popularity and then she will probably fizzle out   Showing cleavage just to get viewers is unfair Girls can have an advantage over guys in that way  Life is not fair You as a guy will never be able to successfully market your sex appeal at least in the foreseeable future on Twitch to get viewers Women however also receive a lot of hate for said marketing which isnt really fair as well At the end of the day an its not fair argument holds no weight when youre talking about an industry that is inherently unfair
191,Yesterday the New York Times [published an article about Twitch and the rest of the livestreaming ecosystem]https:wwwnytimescom20180617businessmediaamazontwitchvideogameshtml  Apparently Twitch has almost four times the amount of average concurrent viewers as its next largest competitor Youtube Gaming  Mixer and other competitors are barely on the map from a purely numerical perspective  Its an interesting read if youre into this aspect of the industry   Whats your opinion on how this affects both new and established streamers?   What are your thoughts on Twitch versus its competitors?    Any other thoughts or discussion points?
192,Every year on November 9th I marathon Cosmos: A Personal Voyage because it was Carl Sagans birthday  I know hes not all that culturally relevant anymore but since Twitch is showing The Joy of Painting commemorating Bob Ross if we had enough support do you think it would be worth seeing if Twitch would do Cosmos too?  
193,Seriously this is becoming really annoying Ive been playing games watching movies listening to songs and speaking in English my whole life Im NOT interested on Brazilian steamers nor I want to watch people speaking Portuguese while playing games so please before I go insane I beg you stop mixing my search lists with content I dont want to see This has been happening all the time on the android app or the twitch website Im just suggesting you let us choose which language we want to watch instead of trying to make me watch something based on where I live
194,Constant lag lots of things not loading properly or at all So many issues have arisen since E3 started Twitch really needs to invest in getting more servers and better equipment Its pretty sad I had to go to youtube for all of my E3 needs this year  Edit: For those saying it was chat or the HTML5 player or whatever let me also add that I was attempting to watch using Livestreamer which bypasses all of that After it continued I went into the twitch channel itself which had close to 500k viewers at the time The ENTIRE chat was essentially filled with LAAAAGGGGGGG It was the same issue I was having with livestreamer I then went to the youtube stream which had no issues and the chat was instead saying stuff like SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS SONY REMAKING A REMAKE LOL This has nothing to do with my PC or anything else Its clearly something on twitches end because it was affecting practically EVERYONE
195,if people wanted to they could go watch VODS thats what they are there for if you miss the stream or we also it takes away from low to mid view brackets of streamers as its usually the same rebroadcasts at the top of the section
196,Hello everyone my wife and I have been streaming every day for around 3 months now and I have been surprised by the amount of younger viewers there are I also run a discord and get to talk to a lot of the viewers Over the past 3 months I have learned that a lot of people use twitch as a way to socialize with others that enjoy the games that they like as well Ive seen many different personalities and Ive had a few people that like to criticize some of the younger viewers for not playing at the same level I cant help but feel the need to defend some of these individuals Some have very rough home conditions depression live in poverty and potentially multiple personality disorders Anyway this is just a reminder that we have a large voice when it comes to these kids They may even look up to us or feel more at home in the stream than in their actual homes Please be kind to one another and try to combat any form of bullying that may pop up What methods have you all come up with for creating a safe environment for people of all ages and in all walks of life?
197,or be open to it in some form he was a gem
198,Ive been streaming before the affiliate program rolled out Yes there was a time where the word affiliate had no meaning on Twitch A time where you were either Partner or not Partner and the only way to sub to someone not Partner was third party extensions It was a time where 3 viewers was nothing to bat an eye at and 50 followers was just another follow  But new and small streamers make reaction videos twitter status posts celebration streams and more to let the world know I did the absolute bare minimum to stream And now I have a cheer and sub button They post threads about how I become affiliate in TWO weeks And YOU can too by following MY advice However I do think you should be proud about being an affiliate but turn it down a few notches The path from affiliate to partner is a grind Affiliate is more of a rite of passage with as much merit as getting a drivers license and calling yourself an adult  EDIT: Come to think of it Ive noticed an increase of streamers who want to be an affiliate ask for follow for follow and lurk for lurk to meet the affiliate requirements There are entire discord and twitter communities to boost streamers into affiliate status this way Sorta sad imo 
199,Hey rTwitch I made a simple and free to use panel maker specifically designed for Twitch streamers  You can check out [the full app here]http:nerdordiecomfreeresourcescustomizabletwitchpanels or watch the [YouTube Video]https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=tSyvWmfI0Mw with full instructions on how to use it  Im doing my best to add in more options and icons as requested  but please feel free to share your opinions on how it can be improved Im actually working on offline image maker that should be done in a few days and an overlay maker that will be complete within a week or so  Your feedback will help make my future projects better  Enjoy  Edit: I wanted to also add in a thanks to [@Tehkhop]https:twittercomtehkhop for helping me on a couple of issues with the code
200,When you get a copyright claim on YouTube they make it a pretty scary experience To file a dispute you have to check a box in BOLD letters saying I understand that filing fraudulent disputes may result in a termination of my YouTube account  Ive found that sometimes a lot of people are too scared to continue If you are truly using free music see the rest of the post then you SHOULD DEFINITELY file a dispute Dont let a false copyright claim steal your money I hope the rest of the post can help you understood a little vocabulary so you have the confidence to dispute claims Or to know when not to if you used a song you werent supposed to  The best foolproof way is to get written permission from the artist to use the song however it wouldnt be feasible to ask most artists to answer the thousands of emails from YouTubers asking to use their song To avoid these mass emails many artists release music under a license called Creative Commons  Many CC licenses allow you to use songs commercially which means you can monetize them And it means if you get a copyright claim on a song that is Creative Commons you SHOULD dispute it Here is how I responded to a copyright claim and an example of what a rock solid copyright claim dispute could look like  EXAMPLE of a dispute: This song is licensed under the CCBY license and was released under this license by the artist MI77ER here: [http:soundcloudcommi77ermusicdreamingforlovecreativecommons]http:soundcloudcommi77ermusicdreamingforlovecreativecommons According to the license: [https:creativecommonsorglicensesby40]https:creativecommonsorglicensesby40 the licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms Please see our video description for indication that we have followed the license terms proper attribution It is clear that this license was granted by the artist himself and is not a counterfeit account Please revoke your copyright claim  When I submitted this copyright dispute I was darn sure I would win because I knew three things I knew what license the song was released under I had the original source showing that license and I had followed the rules by giving attribution in the video description probably the most important part A couple days later I got an email saying the claim had been revoked  VOCAB Time  The following bullets are different parts of a Creative Commons license They can build or stack like legos For example you could see a song with the license of CCBYSANC Each part was stacked on top of the other part   CC  stands for CreativeCommons  NC NonCommercial if the CC license has NC in it dont use it on YouTube  ND  NoDerivatives If the CC license has ND in it dont use it Making a video with this song in it would be considered a derivative  SA ShareAlike This license is good to go for monetizing on YouTube it just means you cant share this song on your own website under a different license  BY  Attribution This license is good to go for monetizing IF you give attribution to the artist  TLDR: CCBY and CCBYSA are good to go  Avoid anything with NC or ND in it  How to give a good attribution:  CCBY and CCBYSA both ask for attribution That means as long as you link back to the original source and give credit to the artist then you can use it commercially A good formula for this I got this from the Creative Commons website is called TASL  T  title of the song  A  artist who wrote the song  S  source of the song  L  license put ccby or ccbysa here  Honestly a simple link back to the artist would be sufficient in most cases Im just suggesting best practices and bulletproof guidelines for confidence against copyright claims  Where to find CCBY and CCBYSA songs:  Soundcloud:  I love soundcloud because you can look at the bottom of the description to see if it has a creative commons license For example this random song on soundcloud shows the ccby license right at the bottom Hover your mouse over the Creative Commons License part and it will show you the specifics  Use this link to practice finding which license is used: [https:soundcloudcomstevenobrienpreludeno6inbminorop2f]https:soundcloudcomstevenobrienpreludeno6inbminorop2f  Unfortunately Soundcloud isnt immune to fraudulent licenses Artists can say that a song was licensed as ccby on Soundcloud and then go after people on YouTube Or they will make remixes that they dont have the right to claim is ccby because they used copyrighted material in the remix I avoid using remixes in my YouTube videos like the plague   YouTube channels:  \Note there a lot of music channels on YT I dont trust because they dont follow attribution rules they link back to themselves rather than linking to the original source of the music Just make sure you can see a source and a license on their YT description   Other than my main YouTube channel I have one on the side called Music Library where I test songs from Soundcloud to make sure they are truly CCBY or CCBYSA If it doesnt pass my tests then I take it down immediately So far Ive been able to clear \~600 songs Im always very clear about where the song came from rather than claiming my channel as the source In addition I always list which license the song is under so you can be sure it is safe to use  Here are some of the playlists I think would be most useful to the twitch community:  EDM

music Just make sure you know what license it is under and you give attribution in your YouTube description If youve done those things then you can have the confidence to fight hard against third party groups that try to steal money from YouTubers Im not joking some untrustworthy publishers use it as way to make money They release a song as CCBY then send an auto copyright claim to YouTubers that dont know any better and get the revenue from their work Dont let that happen to you assuming you arent using music you know you shouldnt be  Last note someone is probably going to mention in the comments that creative commons licenses can be revoked or that a publisher can remove his song from creative commons at any time This is copy and pasted from [creativecommonsorg]https:creativecommonsorg  The CC licenses are irrevocable This means that once you receive material under a CC license you will always have the right to use it under those license terms even if the licensor changes his or her mind and stops distributing under the CC license terms Of course you may choose to respect the licensors wishes and stop using the work  I hope this post was helpful in your search for music and in defending your revenue Cheers
201,I streamed all day pretty much today I recently started streaming and really have been trying to put in the work this week Ive been very lucky and over the past couple days Ive always had a few viewers and chatters Today I was def feeling discouraged though it was the first time I streamed all day with nobody other than my 1 IRL friend and my girlfriend stopping in to say hello while I streamed But at the very end of the night when I was super tired and wanted to stop streaming hours earlier I had 5 new people come in 2 chatters and 3 of them followed It def made the long night worth it and now my shortterm goal of 25 followers is almost there Super excited to stream again tomorrow Anyone feeling discouraged just keep trying and if you got a smile on your face and keep on hanging in there it will pay off   EDIT: holy shit Woke up to a bunch of nice and helpful comments Really appreciate it Then went on my channel and realized a bunch of you guys followed me Seriously thank you so much youre all awesome  EDIT 2: Ive gotten so much feedback from this post I honestly wasnt expecting it Thank you again from the bottom of my heart to everyone that even took the time to read the post Youre all awesome 
202,Twitch gets 12 of the sub money
203,I understand it is very very popular and rakes in money by the mountain That is fine I never once opened a Fortnite stream I dont have any Fortnite streamers subbed andor followed And yet every single fracking time I open up Twitch it will start autoplaying Fortnite right in my face  I Do Not Care About Fortnite Either give me an option like YouTube that Im disinterested in a subjectgame or pick a stream from subjectsgames I have expressed interest in Alternately which honestly would be even better stop autoplaying a stream in my face whenever I open the site I will open the stream I want to watch for myself thank you Im a big boy  Once again Im not hating on Fortnite but over the many months now its getting to the point where I dont even go to Twitch anymore over it When one of the few channels I sub to start streaming I go directly on their channel and that is fine but this also means I cant by chance discover a great content creator I havent known before  Edit: SOLVED
204,Warning: Long af  These are things that I have realized in my past 5 months of being a streamer on Twitch It is about myself how I impact others and how I somehow manage to keep going  I am 23 I have Aspergers high functioning autism extreme anxiety and depression fo days  Starting out in this journey I didnt know what Twitch even was a year ago I met someone who I fell in love with and is a partnered streamer I watched him play for hours and hours and continued asking questions As the nervous nelly I am I didnt want to be on camera I didnt want my photo shown and I didnt want personal information about me on the internet at all I was literally terrified as I was rather sheltered growing up  I continued to ask Tanner aka Kinetic the boyfriend about how OBS works and how chat works what fps means what BR games were and what bitrate was He answered everything to the best of his knowledge knowing that I had a hard time understanding why things work the way they do  He encouraged me often to stream and I really didnt want to yet But I did No cam just a mic and people who I had met from his stream came to cheer me on and give me advice  I played h1z1 because I was interested Was loving it despite my nerves Ended it after a few hours Was itching to do it again and I did Got up to 45 followers and just stopped I got too nervous Way too many people Youd think that was a good thing right?  Started a new account Convinced myself that it was just a fluke Didnt tell anyone I started a new one just started streaming one day Got up to 31 followers and still couldnt bring myself to stream more  After a year long break And some life lessons I decided to try one more time  I joined an organization I met a lot of people through Tanner I connected I finally connected  I am now 5 months into this account An Affiliate 50 subs almost 500 followers 20 daily average viewers And I am thriving  I finally found out what a community is And its my own I found a way to connect I use a face cam I smile all day Im excited to talk to people excited to talk to more people  There are days when there is nobody Just me and good ol Nightbot At first it hurt I was like where are the people who said theyd be here go? Was it me? Is it my music? My gaming? What did I do?  Then after weeks of fretting I decided not to give a crap anymore I was gonna have fun no matter what I turned my music up and focused on ranking up in Rocket League which is now what I stream all the time  After I decided to breathe have fun accept the bad days love the good days and smile through it all I finally learned what it is like to live  Through this incredible gaming community this girl found a way to smile all day through all the hardships of daily life   I know probably none of you know me nor ever will know me and thats totally fine Just know what if you are a streamer who is struggling youll get there May take longer may take shorter Youll get it Believe Turn your music up and stop giving a shit  If youre a viewer you make someone feel like this Thank you  Love always Enter_Moon    edit  Holy crap everyone I didnt expect this kind of reaction This morning so many of you came to visit and give me encouragement and told me Good job keep it up and just those words made me smile from ear to ear I did NOT post this for attention follows or viewers I only wanted to say it because I was feeling some kind of way and needed to share I hope you all know that I appreciate everything and I love this community even more now thanks to you  Please spread this love to all other streamers The little guys are discouraged and need to be shown theyre worthwhile too YOU ARE WORTHWHILE   Never give up  Moon

209,I get asked a lot to help with audio or mic setups by my friends who stream because they know I work in the professional audio industry I finally started to work on a series of short videos discussing the important things that I see Twitch streamers doing wrong or might not even care about These will be short and easy to understand The series should last through the next few weeks so if anyone has any questions or future video suggestions please feel free to post on this thread I can answer anything from analog to digital or surround sound audio capture using OBS Thanks fam :D  Reading The Meter:   [https:youtubenSoZNDPcX5E]https:youtubenSoZNDPcX5E  The Noise Gate:   [https:youtubelBHpEkreRH8]https:youtubelBHpEkreRH8  The Noise Suppressor:   [https:youtubehBXymaeefv4]https:youtubehBXymaeefv4   Compression:   [https:youtube6YCi\_ixuha4]https:lfacebookcomlphp?u=https3A2F2Fyoutube2F6YCi_ixuha43Ffbclid3DIwAR3dQonqn2NHbbjcja_oGGvFPqAeeep_raLXUi9gkB94qkCHAjlRZ4FDSVYh=AT1ml5NbUTFNzhZN2EiKSfFTOmhYeV3DotLCL3OsRJmhVBJkZ_l_Vk6Ih1kRUhEDh9Hu_oQl6Wzf2VPC9uLjXrJMRR2OeDtynP7UjdUQw1erSQU5KzBas8th_pEykLTb7O0bvQEQ9yUIzPcfvA2xTiz66jxmahYtUCCUXbtRO8eBm2aTg35psPuIuwGECfwAb6O36A7mebmGtQqZJzrhbJL318fVobusrgCEU_JviUsofHaGMV5159s_69M9GJgzfbDLMQvbXU0ijfg_CRSEkdXtPOwGJFkBoTfwjzQR8hcSqW4Irgs6XYIjVGE1c4YjlafGcBwiMb6gTT9iO_rn89y9dYAJIk8aXDZ5zvR68dCdqSE_u4syyqBzCI_PCceuv0ziGwSnHJK7TDAdixID40RYW1jJB1R6ZeUFYobd3ccn5fTpiJ7c7y1qxtqVMclAHVz9FRY303HFE   Default Limiter:   [https:youtubeQ6RH0FksgB8]https:youtubeQ6RH0FksgB8   Audio DuckingSidechain:   [https:youtubeX3TLj4LTcNg]https:youtubeX3TLj4LTcNg   EQingVSTsPodcast:   [https:youtube6WwWzlDqMw]https:youtube6WwWzlDqMw   The Audio Chain:   [https:youtubeYazaIamaQw]https:youtubeYazaIamaQw 
210,I love to watch small streamers but I cant always find them because theyre buried beneath the large streams You could say then just follow small streamers but I also enjoy to watch larger streamers sometimes I just wish their was a way to favorite streamers as well as follow to make it much easier to find does anyone else agree   Thanks
211,The 211 update on March 18 broke autoupdate If you updated OBS since then which is likely if you launched it you have to manually download another update Do this ASAP so you can continue receiving updates  Download the latest release at https:githubcomobsprojectobsstudioreleases  EDIT: OBS Studio I found out through their Discord: https:iimgurcomWQBBdcnpng
212,Ive noticed in another thread here that many people are doing a test recording to check their stream setup for quality before going live Though I absolutely applaud those of you who take the time to ensure quality youre leaving yourself open to issues you wont catch   Recording and watchinglistening to the footage on the same computer youre streaming from is not an accurate representation of whats actually being output There are an endless amount of variables that could be skewing your tests including things like the monitor display settings your audio setup etc Youre only confirming what you see in obs is whats being recorded by doing it this way   The better way to go about this quality test is to have a throwaway account for live prestream testing Make the account copy the stream key to a text file on your desktop and clearly separate the two keys for testing and your channel Save it Then when youre preparing to stream youd replace your legit key with the throwaway Have the throwaway dashboard set to a blank channelgame Go live on the throwaway account and monitor it on as many devices as you have  but I would strongly suggest a mobile device on full volume and brightness Mobile devices are calibrated the same from factory as opposed to all the gpu and monitor settings youve likely tweaked  The audio in streams is also very likely to be much different than how it sounds to you on your computer What may sound clear and loud through obs and the recording could be rather muted coming out the other side  Im betting almost anyone who tries this will be surprised at the results   The other benefit is that you can make adjustments in real time rather than having to do it incrementally through the recording process Thats a huge waste of time You can also adjust the stream delay on the throwaway account to allow for quick or delayed feedback from your tests  Its so much more efficient than recording   If youre reading this and dont do prestream testing  thats a major bad and should become a critical part of your pregame even if you play the same game exclusively You may have all kinds of issues that youd otherwise be ignorant to Dont expect your audience to say anything if theres a problem most people wont  theyll just leave This is even more important if you havent earned a loyal viewership because issues youre not aware of may be hindering your growth   Sorry not sorry for the novel  I hope this helps

215,Howdy Reddit legends  x200B;  I need to get something off my chest I am hoping this is taken as constructive and not a whinge or a moan about twitch and their new advertising campaign for twitch prime Dont get me wrong I love streaming  and I am grateful for the opportunity to peruse a passion However I would like to discuss how these advertising changes have impacted my stream as a small streamer  If you dont know what changes I am talking about you can find the details here:   [https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments98wghfsitewide\_adfree\_viewing\_removed\_from\_twitch\_prime]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments98wghfsitewide_adfree_viewing_removed_from_twitch_prime  x200B;   Holding the viewer retention of new viewers in ~~sm~~all channels is pivotal to ~~sm~~all channel growth This is incredibly hard with anyone new to the stream being forced to watch up to 1 minute of advertising     Effect on ~~sm~~ all streamers     My average stream before introduction of new add changes I would recieve \~25 of my viewers from the browse page     Last week of streams I have received between 510 Playing the exact same game at the same time I for one dont like to swap between streams anymore due to having to sit through ads     Overall likely to reduce people switching between streams likely staying in streams they are subscribed too so they dont receive ads  x200B;   Raiding and hosting is a major part of growing for ~~sm~~all streamers You share your community with others who have similar interests to help grow their channel When they return the favour it can really impact on a ~~sm~~all streamers success Networking is key Waiting for an add to finish before raiding is beyond frustrating     Effects on ~~sm~~ all streamers     You miss the reaction from the streamer for the raid     Your viewers and raiders are most likely going to leave rather than having to wait for the advert to finish before seeing the stream     Overall completely Fu\\ng any chance of providing growth and support to friends and fellow ~~small~~ streamers  x200B;   But the major question is are they shooting themselves in the foot? Has the introduction of this aggressive advertising behaviour made viewers seek other alternative streaming services? Maybe?  Regardless these changes have not been well received by my fellow streaming peers it is already hard to swim in the sea of small streamers Please twitch dont make it any harder for us  x200B;  I would appreciate any other comments regarding the negative OR POSITIVE impact of the add changes in the comments  x200B;  Edit 1: a few edits based on comments from peekingboo alot of these issues cause problems for ALL streamers not just small streamers  x200B;
216,https:twittercomemitansstatus497152749906456576  The funny thing is Valve has stated anything in their games can be used for videos on twitchyoutube etc  http:wwwvalvesoftwarecomvideopolicyhtml  So if Valve is not asking Twitch to ban copyright material why exactly did Twitch ban the Dota2 music AT ALL Let alone on the official owners stream  EXAMPLE: http:wwwtwitchtvdota2tib549093223?t=210m  Edit: It seems they have fixed it up  That was quick Funny thing is though there isnt even music playing in the example they muted earlier lol

218,Ive created a website called [TwitchSwitch]http:twitchswitchtv that allows users to find random Twitch streams The purpose is to help users discover new streamers and games      How does it work?   When you first launch the site you will be shown a random stream from Twitch If you dont like it you can click Switch to be shown a new random stream If you log into the site you can also follow or chat with any streamers you come across      Do you want to just sit back and relax? Well you can with our auto switch feature Just click the auto switch button and you will be shown a new stream every 45 seconds Have a favorite game? Just type it into the game filter and you will be shown random streams for only that game If you want to watch streams in another language just choose your preferred language from the drop down      How can I get my stream on TwitchSwitch?   As long as you are live on Twitch and have at least 3 viewers you can be found on TwitchSwitch You do not need to login to our site to show up      Idea behind TwitchSwitch:   I enjoyed using Discover on Twitch to find random streams but I felt like I was still making the decision to click on the stream based on the thumbnail title or viewer count I decided to create this site to take away those decisions and put a streamer in front of you You actually get to experience the streamer first hand before making the decision to stay or find another I want people to branch out and find other streamers on Twitch Of course we all have our favorites but there are some awesome streamers out there that you may not have ever seen      If you have any questions or have feedback feel free to post a comment below I will do my best to answer them all

220,I was getting a lot of questions of people who wanted to or were just starting to stream and wanted advice So as the title suggests I made part 1 of a video series I plan to make about helping streamers with both the technical side of streaming and the content game personality etc side of streaming Hopefully if you are interested in streaming yourself this video and series can help you get a good start  https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=1IjS5RCgZosfeature=youtube  This is the first video like this that Ive ever made and making videos is apparently quite a bit different than streaming so its a little rough at some points but I tried my best and hopefully will get better as the series progresses  I really want feedback as to what you liked  didnt like and what you would want to know more about in upcoming parts to the series 
221,Seriously I fucking hate whatever you advertise because I just see it over and over whenever I look at a new stream or anything Fuck Twitch
222,Hey rTwitch For a long time Ive wanted to make something that people could use to make and customize their own intro AFK inqueue or outro scenes without the use for Photoshop Gimp and other image editing software  Useful Links  [Get the Scene Maker here]https:nerdordiecomproductscenemakerfree  [Example of scene I created]http:imgurcomaYUc5T  [Full walk through video here]https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=NZikbHghK0Q  [Full written guide here]https:nerdordiecomfreeresourcesfreescenemaker  Whats all included?  Youll be able to download files that will run your scene locally on your computer Youll be able to use our settings generator to customize the following features:   Custom Background images or video  blur on backgrounds  Add Your Logo or Branding Image  Custom Colors for your fonts frame background overlay and more  Ability to use nearly ANY Google Font  Stream Labels such as your Recent Follower Tippers and subs  Built in animated schedules and social media popup  Scaling of certain sections  Countdown timer and messages  And much more  You will need to create an account on my site to use This will allow you to track any downloads youve made and helps reduce spam etc to my site  Known Issues  Background videos will not loop if theyre too long In this case I recommend adding in your video directly through OBS Studio  Performance issues with videos inside of OBS browser  If you dont have a higher end PC there will be noticable frame drops due to blur effects and color mixing I suggest here that you also add your video directly through OBS Studio  This is only fully tested in OBS Studio Most features should work in any software that allows you to import local webpages But some features may not work as intended  Planned Features  In the near future Id like to add the ability to import your settings file into our settings generator Making it easier to edit future scene designs  In the future Ill also be releasing more templates for designs as well Ones with higher levels of animations and some other features that were left out of this base design  Your Feedback  rTwitch has always been extremely helpful to my projects so I very much look forward to hearing what you all think is good bad and could be done to make this even better  Look forward to more projects like this coming in the near future
223,One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to viewing a stream on Twitch is when the streamer talks to me when Ive said nothing in chat Look I understand that if Im youre only viewer youre excited to see me viewing your stream I understand that you think interacting with your viewers is the way to keep viewers I even understand that you are simply trying to be kind and welcoming to make me feel comfortable But what you dont know is that it makes me feel uncomfortable It annoys me because then I feel obligated to speak to you when I really didnt want to say anything It makes me not want to watch because I know youre going to talk to me the entire time and Im not looking for conversation And lastly it makes me not follow you   Now you might be asking why and the reason why is because sometimes I dont want to talk I just want to watch or listen I turn a random stream on to have it play as background noise while Im doing other things Im not looking for interaction Im not looking to be greeted I just want to have the stream playing in the background and if the streamer just so happens to say something funny or if I happen to look over and like what I see Ill follow them If I want to be social Ill say something 999 of the time when Im lurking thats what I want to do Lurk Im sure Im not the only one who feels this way   So please if youre a streamer be mindful that not everyone wants to talk to you Some people want to come in watch you play the game and not say anything You dont have to greet every viewer you have I would recommend you dont greet anyone unless they speak in chat Otherwise you run the risk of running a potential follower away
224,Amazon is giving us a new game everyday this month to celebrate Prime Day Pillars of Eternity is already available and [here]https:cdngamernetworknet2018articles201807031038prime_day_free_twitch_gamesjpg is an image showing all of the games to come
225,How much did you pay the Fallout 4 team for development advice?  Note: I use an iPad and the update feels like it was an update meant for an iPhone 4  The new app is like going from Fallout:NV to Fallout 4 Yeah a few things are cool making clips BUT YOUVE REMOVED THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES  1 Why in the world can I no longer view the stream and chat at the same time in landscape and in portrait why does it cover the screen??  2 What is the point in the swiping streams option? Id view what all the people Im following are streaming before choosing one not just swiping blindly then being stuck on an ad ALL IT DOES IS MAKE ME ACCIDENTALLY GO OFF A STREAM I WANT TO WATCH  3 Things such as the on screen volume have gone Why?  4 Why have you cluttered everything into 3 tabs?   5 Changing the format of the followed channels is really bad the thumbnails are now tiny and 50 of the screen is now just purple The old one was SOOOOO much better The live tab should look like the when you view streams playing a certain game  6 Why have you removed the picture in picture button? I know I have to now go full screen and press the home button  7 The new fade in  other animations in general make the whole app feel slow and unresponsive  8 The screen significantly darkening while the options are up is just annoying  9 A lot of the buttons feel hit and miss  10 The paste copy and select options disappearing when someone says something in the chat issue hasnt been fixed yet  11 Why does options and share now cover a huge portion of the screen for no reason look at the old version  Overall this update seems like a massive downgrade I would be so much happier and Im sure most people would agree if I could just use the older version  EDIT: 12 Apparently Airplaychrome casting is broken you can find the comment below  EDIT: 13 ubrahbocop has noticed ads appearing on subscribed streams  EDIT: I just wanted to add a little foot note I know app development is hard but update which removes features is unexcusable especially when were paying them subscribing   EDIT: 14 Using the physical android back button supposedly doesnt work  EDIT: 15 Watching clips is fucked
226,Aesthetics opinions aside I really dislike the fact that the side bar only displays the top 5 channels you follow This change will seemingly promote bigger channels and hurt smaller ones I understand you can still go to your following tab or you can click load more channels on the bar itself but why?  They added an extra step that wasnt there before I think they are trying to push the friends feature on twitch Which is probably why it takes over half the side bar nowI have 0 friends added on twitch but this is still the case But shouldnt the priority be to get you to watch a stream and not to chat with friends I use twitch to watch streams I have 10 other ways to chat with friends I get they want to promote a new feature but I think this makes the user experience worse and might actively cost smaller channels viewers  Maybe I am overthinking it People can probably get used to going to their following tab and whatnot But in my opinion they shouldnt make old features harder to use to promote new ones  EDIT: Well now I have 2 side bars http:iimgurcomqpx9Gaejpg Probably temporary but funny nonetheless
227,Like many people I stream on twitch Like many people as well I usually have no one watching my twitch streams However I actually dont mind having no one watch my streams In fact I quite enjoy it Sometimes I have a viewer pop in and talk and I love talking to them but I also dont mind having no one watching Here is why  1 The first reason I dont mind is the fact that it sometimes helps me be a better person I play heroes of the storm mostly and honestly I was a pretty toxic player When I started to stream I was still toxic and I talked like it too I thought no one was watching so I was like whatever until one day someone came in and said toxic streamer FeelsBadMan I tried to defend myself but the viewer ended up unfollowing me and not coming back It was then I decided to reform Even though no one was watching me there was still a chance someone could come and watch me So I started to accept my own mistakes stop blaming others for my loses and before I knew it I was a reformed HoTS player who climbed from the bronze level to Gold V Thanks to having that pressure of not knowing if someone is watching I have became a much less toxic player  2 The second reason I dont mind streaming to no one is because I just love to talk I can go on and on and on and on and on and on talking to my friends but even they get tired of hearing me sometimes You know who doesnt get tired of hearing me? Me I love going back to my VODS and seeing me play and hearing me talk and laughing at my own mistakes and feeling good about my successes The fact that I can just relax and talk and talk into my mic without anyone judging me just makes me feel so much better about streaming and being a small streamer  3 I can just be myself And thanks to being able to stream on twitch people like me can join me I may not be able to have 50 25 or even 35 people watch me but that doesnt mean I dont have to change who I am I am a anime loving HoTS playing panchan shirt wearing streamer and thats who I like to be Like I said in point 2 I love going back to my VODS and see me just being me Even though I get no viewers just knowing that I am able to stream to the whole world and be me and let no one change who I am makes me feel a whole lot better in myself Heck even though no one is watching just knowing I am showing myself as a weeb to the world gives me more confidence in putting it out there that I love anime irl the kids where I live absolutely HATE ANIME WITH A PASSION  So I dont know what you all can take away from this I just felt like sharing why I actually dont mind being a small streamer who no one watches In fact I feel like it has benefited me in more ways than money can Im studying to become a history teacher and to be the teacher I want to be I need to be confident in who I am Thanks to twitch I have grown more confident in who I am even though no one has seen it Thanks for reading :
228,Seems like the site is down just noticed as I was about to stream  EDIT: DONT REFRESH TO TEST IF YOURS WORKS otherwise you screwed yourself  EDIT 2: WE BACK
229,So with each passing scandal it is getting more laughable with the way Twitch chooses to deal with them  Whereas a regular nonpartnered streamer seemingly can get banned for the smallest infraction the partners on twitch now  seem to be running the aylum I may be miscounting or missing people but the only times this year I can recall partners  actually being permanently banned on twitch is when it got the attention of the authorities out in the wider world negative press  or game companies were putting pressure on them to do something about particular streamers  With all the latest CS:GO betting scandal coming out over the past few weeks Twitch as usual was slow to react and would have done nothing if not for Valve who are also at fault for not doing anythingsooner Yet the streamers who have commited fraud on THEIR platform seemingly get away scot free while claiming ignorance when there is concrete proof about their duplicity  The latest streamer implicated just a few hours ago will again Im sure not even get a warning let alone a ban what will it take for partners to actually be banned? Particularly with this CS:GO stuff would it take criminal proceedings for them to take action?  One of the big issues I have seen over a long period of time is that a lot of the bigger streamers the ones that can get away with literal murder on stream are so friendly with the staff some of whom are literal streamer groupies in their interactions in chat I personally still feel it may be considered a conflict of interest for staff to be subscribed to stremers but thats just my personal opinion These same staff are the ones looking out for these people and deflecting a lot of the flak away and I get that their friends but they should keepo business and personal seperate as they are at this point consistently making Twitch look amateurish  Again I understand this is pretty much all about the money at this point and why would Twitch ban someone who gets 10k viewers? Wouldnt it be better to have a platform with respected honest stremers instead of letting some of your partners literally commit criminal actions on your site just so you can get a little more ad and sub revenue?  This is just a minor vent I have a LOT of issues with some of the dumb stuff that has been going on lately and I am pretty much convinced that nothing will change the site will keep going downhill at this current rate and I dont care how viewers may be going upthe site is just becoming worse from the top down
230,http:wwwtwitlongercomshown_1snlj3r  :
231,update:  update2:  got some more automated answers according to them everything is working as expected and the subscriptions got refunded thats why I got no revenue from them When I asked how it is possible for the Dashboard to look 2 months into the future to see cancelled subs 2month later and update that 000 revenue on the first day i got this sub and that i am surprised that you can cancel subscriptions after 2 months and an automatic renewal they just sent me this:      >Hello genbatzu  The system is working as expected unfortunately the way that your revenue was offset caused this confusion I do apologize for the inconvenience  Thank you  update:  got an answer from twitch support yesterday and it wasnt a standardized macro answer instead they acknowledged that it seems that not all of the sub revenue is being reported to \[my\] dashboard  \  [https:abloaddeimgbildschirmfoto201805hbow3png]https:abloaddeimgbildschirmfoto201805hbow3png  First of all Im an affiliate on twitch so Im eligible to receive cheers and subs last month something strange happened as on one day i got 3 subs 2 tier 1 5; 1 tier 3 25 As everyone knows affiliate split is 5050 after tax fees etc  However from these 35 subs I received 231 which is pretty much exactly 6637; before I pay taxes and withdraw fees etc Or another way to look at it is that i got the correct cut of 5037; after tax etc from 1 Tier1 Sub and got 037; cut from 2 subscriptions 1 Tier1 1 Tier3 The latter is most likely but doesnt make for a dramatic title  I obviously contacted support about it a week later because I thought it might just isnt updated correctly or something so I waited a bit but the conversation with the support dragged on after I contacted it  First of all they seemed to acknowledge the problem as the support employee escalated it to the finance department after Ive provided a couple of screenshots  2 weeks later I got a standardized macro answer that I should switch to google DNS which should solve the problem This obviously didnt solve anything and I was using google DNS anyway So I answered that I already use google DNS and it didnt fix anything  A day later I got another standardized macro answer that the payout is correct and I can read about the certain cost fees and taxes that apply in the Twitch Affiliate Program As Im not a US citizen I pay my own taxes on twitch gains so they cant mean my income taxes I have no clue how US citizen handle that but there was something about that in the amazon agreement about it but I assume they mean VAT  2 of these Subscriptions got renewed this month both Tier1 subs and revenue this time was 231 again which leads me to believe that one sub is working and the 2nd one is faulty and produced a revenue of 037;  I replied again obviously and told them that its really strange to have 230 revenue from 35 subs and after that I got yet another standardized macro answer telling me that its usually caused by cancelled subscriptions which arent reflected on that specific day but on a later day as a negative revenue number and I dont have to worry I dont own Twitch money for it how nice  A cancelled Subscription wasnt the case of course So I explained it again that it cant be that either because these subscribers are using sub emotes till today so they cant have cancelled their subs  tl;dr from 35 sub revenue I received 231 and Twitch first acknowledged that as an error then told me to change my DNS settings then told me its working as expected and all is fine and finally told me its because of cancelled subscription which its not
232,Im fine with ads I know it costs money to run twitch and every bit helps including buying bits and watching ads for streamers and the platform alike Im not blocking ads on Twitch app dont even know you can or Browsers when I watch VODs But   Hosting plays ads and its killing my hosting viewership experience apologies for muh experience meme After I watch the ad and come back to the channel the hosting hypes died down I want to see reactions from streamers and viewers not after everything died down after watching a 12 minute ad   I just wish there were like an option to delay ads to play say like a minute after a streamer is hosted so I can view ads after the hosting hypes died down It takes less than a minute for a streamer to thank the host and the viewers and go back and I think the ads can wait
233,So this is probably an unusual case  several months ago I had a user show up in my chat and immediately start criticizing my gameplay and in general just being rude to me and several members of my chat which he got banned for   About a month ago this same user showed up in a channel I moderate for and started harassing me completely unprovoked  so he was banned from there    Then this user retaliated  It turns out this person is a mod in 254 streams and he banned me from almost all of them  Most of these streams I had never been to before  Im at a complete loss of words for this situation  I tried reaching out to the user but received no response and got blocked on twitch and twitter   x200B;   Has anyone been in a similar situation and have some tips or some help?  Is there anything I can do to report abuse of mod powers on this large of a scale? This whole thing is crazy to me 
234,Let it be known you were here  Update: Power has been restored to the city of light your streams should be back up if you refresh
235,Really sucks having the ads stutter from buffering receiving 52Mbps from WiFi when the streams themselves only take 15Mpbs at max
236,The title is mostly all If we want to engage and start conversation we will There are a ton of people who bounce around streams looking to find something that interests them Its a big turn off when I click on a stream and I am instantly called out from the viewer list 
237,A new guide is posted almost daily it seems recently They are carbon copies of each other and offer nothing new just clutter the sub with
238,Let me say first and foremost that if you are not consistent in your schedule or are not continually improving yourself as a broadcaster and entertainer then you are severely limiting the effectiveness of any tool or strategy you try to use Really You have a mic you might have a cam you want an audience so you need to first learn how to put on a show      With that out of the way DISCORD is the best tool for streamers out there IF you are willing to learn how to use it right Why? It works its everywhere its aimed at gamers and streamers theyve had a solid year catering to us and if they stay on this path it will only become better     Heres how to use Discord   Use it as a home base for your own community of viewers to hang and make a stronger connection with in between streams     Use its voice chat to easily chat with when playing with viewers With video coming this opens up opportunities for more exclusive things for loyal viewers or as sub perks    Network with other streamers and develop a hub of Discords that you use to cross promote and be active in OR    Have one Discord that houses several streamers or a Team to make interaction and planning easier and becomes a better melting pot of combined viewers to have fun with Voice chat makes things easier here as well    You can find many other streaming communities that use Discord as a means to connect like minded people together Goals include learning from each other finding people to game with who understand streaming and supporting each other in ways that go beyond just follows and hosts Being involved with several discords is as easy as can be if you can juggle it    [Discord Bots]https:wwwcarbonitexnetDiscordbots can tailor the experience you want the people there to have with polls games gamespecific integrations [service integrations]https:discordappcomstreamkit information sharing memes music and can even be set to alert people what you are playing and when you and whoever you deem worthy go Live on Twitch If youve built a community of engaged people this can be a HUGE benefit   If you create content on other platforms like YouTube or social media you can make Discord a hub for all of that content much like a website but easier :     It is super late for me so I am sure there are other things I am not thinking about that can be done though Discord I am in no way affiliated with them I just have a desire to share what has made the biggest impact for me this year Im sure this can be duplicated on other platforms Networking as a streamer is best used when you build relationships with people that you in one way or another can make great content with For people wanting that secret there it is But surprise surprise it will still take WORK to take full advantage of what is possible Ill say this from experience: IT IS WORTH IT
239,I just HAD to share this because it just happened and I am still pinging from it  A little background: Typically per stream I get around 612 viewers and lately I was getting pretty down about my channel not growing any further it grew pretty fast pretty quick and then hit a roadblock Tonight I wanted to play some ghost recon PVP with my mates but I was not planning on streaming at all They kept telling me I should and I was all nah Im not in the mood no one will come anyway I ended up streaming because I just thought I might aswell and as I expected no one really showed up for the first hour hour and a half I had like between 14 viewers I dont keep an eye on it during stream but after stream I check my stats then something amazing happened I got hosted by another streamer with 30 viewers and most if not all stayed  By this point I was all excited saying hi to all the new faces got a tonne of new followers just when I thought things couldnt get any betterUBISOFT HOSTED ME  I couldnt believe it I thought it was fake at first especially because ubisoft were in the chat talking but it was legit they tweeted me and everything INSANE   By the end of the night I had soo many new followers and chatters it was awesome even had some donations  I suppose my point of writing all of this is that I felt so crap today and did not want to stream I was so down and out about life and thought streaming would make me feel worse BUT it ended up being an amazing stream which I am so grateful for and it really lifted my spirits  TLDR: Streaming can be an amazing thing and you never know what will happen during your stream so dont be disheartened
240,I want to say a very big THANK YOU to everyone in chat whos watching Twitchs marathon of the Pokemon animated series Not sure how many people will see this but I think its more likely to be seen here than in a constantly scrolling twitch chat Plus I can use this post to suggest others to come and watch with us to  Thank you for:  \All the NEVER SEEN AGAINs when Ash and friends part ways with a one off character that they promise to see again but never do I dont know why but that gets me every time xD And all the DEAD ACTUAL MURDER when something that should kill a normal person happens  x200B;  \Keeping count of all the PITY BADGEs Ash receives and pointing out flaws in the animes logic Got me to question things that I never even considered when watching episodes by myself   x200B;  \Attempting to sing the theme tune together in chatHavent got it right yet; lets keep trying I love ABSOLUTE BANGER INCOMING when a new musical piece appears  x200B;  \Peoples reactions to Pokemon movies that they and I havent seen before   x200B;  And all the trivia and little funny and heart warming moments chat adds to watching Pokemon episodes backtoback  x200B;  The main reason I want to say thanks is because recent events which are out of my control have left me severely depressed to the point of seeking medical help I wont go into specifics because quite frankly therapy has taught me that if its out my control then I shouldnt fixate on it But I have a real issue with overthinking and not being able to let things go so it still gets me down a lot Theres really not a lot for someone my age to do where I live A good description of where I live would be retirement home island I gym but thats about it All my friends are online because theyve moved away for uni or for life elsewhere and we dont talk often because theyre often busy; I feel pretty alone as a result  x200B;  Since I was maybe like 8 or so ive loved Pokemon Ive played all the games collect cards and figures use to collect them at least not so much now and remember the first few series of the anime Kanto Orange islands Johto and Hoenn fondly Call it sadcheesy but I was bullied and socially awkward as a kid and it was just nice to have my own special little friends my Pokemon :P While what I accomplished in those games means nothing in reality gradually overcoming opponents and becoming the champion made me happy Eventually I found others who liked Pokemon I made friends became part of a community and I felt a sense of belonging  x200B;  Even now its something I can playwatch and get immersed in; never fails to cheer me up When I heard Twitch was doing a marathon I thought I could use cheering up right now But the more I watched it the more I found myself watching the chat more than the show  The chat was full of people I could relate to and for the first time in a long time; I didnt feel so alone  x200B;  Pretty sappy towards the end there but just wanted to say thanks again chat for adding a new twist to a series im familiar with and kinda being there for me to If you wanna come join here you go: [https:wwwtwitchtvtwitchpresents]https:wwwtwitchtvtwitchpresents     x200B;
241,I guess it wasnt sniping but I definitely had a viewer get into my game  I am probably one of the smallest streamers on this sub I have 18 followers and usually no viewers  One day I was streaming Escape From Tarkov a viewer in chat started talking to me so I was having a conversation with them Im getting ready to load up into my next raid and I see the viewer in the lobby user name was the same as twitch and pretty unique I dont think I encountered the viewer however  I know stream sniping is an issue for big streams but I was actually amused that someone tried to stream snipe me  Actually felt kinda good  Good times

243,Can you just leave the frontend untouched? Also I need my BTTV  It literally kills my mood to spend time on Twitch when BTTV is not working due to generally useless for a user Twitch updates   Oh I wish this site was good in vanilla
244,So this seems like it should be pretty common sense Im sure but for whatever reason I never thought about it until pretty recently   So yes watch your archived videos of your streams  Youll get a whole different perspective than what you experience as the person recording the stream  Youll get to see it from your viewers side along with all the av issues you might have quality issues content issues EVERYTHING    And dont just think that a 5 minute clip is enough  Literally try to sit there through as much of your video as you can  Do you enjoy watching the show youre putting on?  Are you having fun?  Does it seem like youre interacting with people in chat enough?  Are you just looking for excuses to alttab to something else and stop watching the stream?  if so figure out why  Take notes on the little or big things that you notice need to be changed  For me a couple things that stood out are issues with audio levels because despite doing checks prestream for whatever reason every device and every set of headphones I try to use to watch my tests outputs wildly different audio levels  which also seem to be different from the audio in the videos  and then people in chat tell me my levels are off and things get wonky  I still dont have a great solution for that yet but Im working on figuring one out  Or another thing is that I have my webcam on the monitor in front of me but my stream chat on my righthand monitor  So every time I interact with people in chat it looks to them like Im looking away  and its weird  For real though if you havent tried it yet give it a shot  what sort of things stand out to you?  EDIT  to have twitch archive past streams go to Dashboard > Settings Scroll down to Stream Preferences and tick the box for Store Past Broadcasts
245,There are too many IRL streamers not disclosing what they are doing 
246,Please fix weird voices start talking in the middle of the night
247,Im part of a few streaming communities and Im new myself so take my words with a grain of salt   I know sometimes we look at viewership surges on a good day and get excited and then get bummed out when we done see them again but remember: you are building  a community you arent looking to have a huge surges youre looking for a steady swell Those two three users that always show up and chat? Talk to them learn their names their lives and appreciate them This is where  a channel grows Followers are cool but having those three or four consistent concurrent viewers? Thats important That doesnt mean you cant focus on growth its just saying that you should appreciate who enables that growth 
248,They literally pop up one after the other Twitch obviously takes notice because they get banned after a bit but realistically they should be deleted immediately when reaching such an absurd viewer to follower ratio
249,Twitch pls
250,Twitter is arguably THE social media to use as a Twitch Streamer  Youd be hard pressed to find a large streamer that doesnt Tweet constantly and [some even tell their viewers how great it is]https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=i8jKUTNnX3ot=94s So clearly Twitter is a big deal  The question is whats the best way to use it?  Fortunately for us Twitter has been the subject of quite a few studies over the years While its difficult to get data specific to Twitch streamers more on that later there are a lot of general studies with lessons that we can apply to Twitch streamers on Twitter  In this post I set out to determine a couple of things:  1 How many tweets should we aim for each day according to research? 2 What kinds of content hashtags images mentions etc should we include in tweets for maximum impact? 3 What else should we know about Twitter?  I was pretty surprised by the answers I found especially for the third question  Please note: this post was originally designed for a blog including graphs research link and more To see the full formatting go [here]https:trugamingcommasteringtwittertwitchstreamer  Heres what I learned       How Many Times Should I Tweet Each Day? This is one question that I see a lot particularly from new streamers  If you ask around youll get a lot of different answers Some streamers say that one tweet a day is plenty; others will tell you that anything less than 5 is pointless  Interestingly research is sort of similar Theres a lot of debate about what the magic number for Tweeting is even scientifically  However there are some trends that can help Basically if you want to aim for a number of tweets each day try for 35   A [2013 study]http:wwwsocialbakerscomblog1847tweetingtoomuchfindouttheidealtweetfrequencyforbrands from Social Bakers tested a random sample of 11K tweets and found the sweet spot for average engagement to be about 3 tweets    Similarly a 2012 [Track study]http:tracksocialcomblog201210optimizingtwitterengagementpart2howfrequentlytotweet found that Retweets specifically increase with tweets up to 45 and then fall off before increasing again  Technically Retweets increase all the way up to about 30 Tweets a day but for the purposes of a practical goal for streamers we recommend about 35 per day  If you have time to Tweet more go for it  An important note on these studies  both are a few years old at this point the Twitter hype has died down a bit since it launched  However we think they are still relatively valid when compared with our own Twitter analytics data To get the best strategy for your stream be sure to take a look at your own Twitter analytics data  If youre looking to start Tweeting aim for 3 tweets each day If you want to push a stretch goal bump that up to 5        What Should I Include In My Tweets? There are a lot of great ways to spice up your Tweets  pictures GIFs links hashtags etc  So what are the best things to include in a Tweet to help it stand out?  Lets take a look at what research says   ImagesMedia  This is one that everyone sort of knows but the research is still pretty overwhelming  A number of studies 1 2 3 have found images to be the single most powerful way to increase Tweet engagement Simply including an image can be enough to triple favorites and retweets    Links  Surprisingly a few studies found that including links in tweets can actually hurt you more than help For subjects with a low to moderate social authority tweets with links performed worse than those without  Of course as a Twitch streamer you have to drop that link at some point  Our advice to you is to mix up your tweets  be sure to have a fair number of tweets without links to drive engagement with your community    Hashtags  Hashtags are a particularly tricky topic for Twitch streamers with such an abundance of streamer hashtags going around While wed love to do a study on streamer hashtags in particular heres what we found about hashtag use in general:  Hashtags slightly increase engagement in Tweets but not much  Overall you should use hashtags in your tweets but dont bank on them for success Imagesvideos are much more effective than hashtags for engagement  Streamer hashtags may be a different beast  were hoping to test this soon More below    Mentions  Mentions seem to have conflicting results in studies The key factor seems to be social authority; that is the level of influence that a user has on Twitter  For low social authority accounts mentions are actually somewhat useful  However  if you have moderatetohigh social authority mentions can actually backfire  An important note  even though research supports mentions be careful not to dump mentions on Twitter Massmentioning not only violates Twitter TOS it also just looks bad to everyone else    Overall if youre looking to ramp up tweet engagement be sure to:  1 use images as often as possible 2 use occasional hashtagsmentions 3 use links only when necessary     What Else Should I Know About Twitter? During my research I discovered a few more bits of Twitter knowledge that didnt fit nicely in the last two categories  Heres what Ive got for you:  Time of day doesnt matter  In most of the studies I looked at time of day had little impact on tweet engagement  Be careful of sources that tell you to post at certain times of the day The pictures are fancy but when you look a bit deeper theres no actual data to support their advice    Similar tweets can actually be helpful but duplicate tweets are BAD  I was surprised to learn that similar repeated tweets can actually still drive decent engagement  According to this study from Wisemetrics you can still have about 60 of your original tweets engagement after tweeting about the same news 6 times  That said do NOT use copyandpaste repeat tweets Be sure to change up the wording Repeating identical tweets is a violation of Twitter TOS     Replying to Tweets is a BIG deal  If youre not doing it yet you probably should be  Although focused mainly on business use a number of recent studies have found replying to Tweets to be one of the most effective way to drive sales clicks and engagement  Again although this study was businessfocused the findings absolutely translate to Twitch streamers  The faster and more often you can reply to members of your community when they Tweet at you the more commitment they will feel towards you    That pretty much wraps up my findings for this first article  Twitter is a BIG topic though so you can expect a part 2 at some point in the future specifically targeted at Twitch streamer data on Twitch  Curious? Read on      Help Us Do More Research Earlier I mentioned that Id love to get specific data on streamer hashtag use on Twitter Problem is no one out there is conducting studies on this stuff  Until now   With the help of Twitch streamers of all sizes we are launching a miniproject for the purpose of researching growth strategies on Twitch  What if we could test the impact of hosting small vs large streamers?  What if we could see how much difference adding SupportSmallStreamers to a tweet really makes for stream growth?  These are the kinds of questions were tackling and we need your help  If youd like to help us blow stuff up in a lab  er research data  all you have to do is send me a message  Each week well be researching what science says about Twitch growth instead of opinion Its a great way to improve as a streamer and also a fantastic way to network with some amazing streamers  If all goes well well post the results of our findings here via Twitch Thursday articles   Hope you enjoyed this and see ya next week    EDIT: Formatting didnt work out the best with linking studies  if you want to validate all the research in my post you can see it [here]https:trugamingcommasteringtwittertwitchstreamer
251,I use my twitch prime monthly on them but other than that how do I help them grow? Obviously bits and donations help but is there any way to promote them? I really think they could do awesome with a larger viewer base and I really want to see them succeed 
252,Firstly id like to say what is the point to subscribe to any channel when you can just run a black screen under the ads meaning your subscription gets you no extra content?    Which is exactly why I have unsubscribed to the channels I have subscribed to as I see this being the future of Twitch I didnt subscribe to people for the emoticons they were just the bonus I subbed to people for the ad free experience so I could get more content    Since I get no more content and I am not subbed for emoticons; subscriptions Twitch Prime Turbo or Bits or any other promotional feature are useless    Now with that out of the way lets get onto why I am relating to the Twitch Presents marathons Im sure everyone has heard about the abhorrent ad times on the [content]https:oddshottvsGcFPMc where its ads credits ad then multiple advertisements inbetween the shows This is why I ditched my TV for the internet and now its being forced upon me to watch multiple ads?   The reason I watch Twitch Presents is because of the chat the jokes and the reliability between people who have similar interests to me If I really wanted I could go and watch YuGiOh RWBY or any other show on the internet freely without constant interruptions or having to pay on another streaming website     Im not going to ask others to unsubscribe from channels because of the ads Twitch is forcing on everyone Its your money you can do what ever you want with it but if this doesnt change I expect many others like myself will follow suit    Edit: someone said Twitch Presents isnt a normal channel it is It has a sub button and a viewer base Yet we havent seen ads in the Bob Ross streams or Pokemon streams Forcing ads has been a recent change which is not needed or wanted by many
253,Its basically there in the title It would be specifically organic chemistry so I would be drawing organic structuresmolecules using a drawing software and answering questions Anyone see  why this wouldnt be allowed? I read the rules for twitch creative and didnt see an objection Just wanted another opinion Also please let me know your thoughts on the idea  Edit: I really appreciate all the support everyone This is amazing and I never thought this post would see this much traffic I do want to point out that I am an undergraduatejunior pursuing a bachelors of science in chemistry with plans of a PhD I am not a professor nor an expert I love chemistry and thats my reason for this discussion I just wanted to forewarn some people who I think assumed I know more than I do Thanks  Edit: I will certainly be doing a chemistry type stream based on the feedback Per the rules of rTwitch I cannot post my stream link here However and I hope this okay I have posted it on my Reddit bio which can be accessed by clicking on my username

256,This is probably one of the most conflicted messages Ive ever written so bear with me while I try to process thisshare my story Its a hard one to tell on a few levels although Ill try to keep it short  I have suffered from chronic depression since I was 12 currently 32 years old It comes and goes every few months some cycles worse than others some years worse than others and over time through therapy medication and just pure elongated existence Ive learned to manage it for the most part most of the time   Part of what has helped me over recent years is being able to connect with other people who are also struggling and help show them there is light ahead There is hope there are solutions medication DOES help if you get on the right stuff for you and you can do ANYTHING in this world if you are willing to fight for it Sometimes we all just need a bit of help with that fighting part and thats completely normal and OK as well   So this said Ive always been super open with my viewers about whats going on with me I often feel put off by it like people will feel Im seeking attention by being open about how I feel which is not my intention at all and luckily so far Ive never had anyone accuse me of being a scumbag like that Im not honestly   Recently Ive been struggling pretty hard though I sort of stepped passed my personal mental boundaries put myself in a situation where I knew I shouldnt have due to my instability and it ended up backfiring as expected leaving me in a heap As such I havent been streaming much these past three weeks as Ive barely been able to keep myself together using all the tools Ive acquired over the years and thats left me pretty damn miserable to put it lightly   Because I dont like leaving my viewers hanging wondering what happened to me or if Im ok I put a message up on my channel explaining what was going on as well as on discord so everyone would know I am alive working on getting better getting back on medication because I stupidly stopped taking it a while back thinking this time youll be fine ha   What happened next really shook my whole philosophy of being open Later that night after posting that message I start getting calls on discord from a viewerfriend He starts sending me very frantic messages saying he needs to talk to me its super important I was not feeling like talking to anyone so I ignored the first few until he sent me a picture of himself covered in blood with glass stuck in his hands and messages of call me   So I called him He was crying his eyes out telling me he hurt himself so he could feel my pain hed apparently filled his sink up with wine glasses and been punching them for a while He told me I was important that I mattered That I needed to tell him I matter That I needed to tell him how I was going to be ok or he was going to keep doing it until I believed him So I told him of course I will be fine I know I will be fine anyway Ive been through depression like this before Its not pleasant and yes my mind does go to some dark places when Im like this but Ive also been down this road enough times to recognize the familiar feel when those suicidal thoughts creep in to KNOW they stem only from a chemical imbalance in my brain not due to any real world horrors that my mind creates  I talked to him long enough to get him to go to a hospital Talked to him the whole way there made sure he got help But something Id never considered was just how my actions and words up to this point can affect someone who is more mentally unstable than I I never considered how it made other people feel to hear someone they care about is hurting in such a way This was obviously an extreme case and obviously its not my fault or anything for his actions but for the sake of protecting others who are more vulnerable than I I dont think I will be quite as open in the future about such things   People always say Im brave for talking so openly about depression; I dont think they realize it comes from a total lack of connection with the world that I feel I tell people about my issues the same way Id tell someone about the weather; its a factual based thing this is who I am also its sunny and 66 degrees today Ive come to the realization this casual approach isnt always so casual for people who are unstable and there are likely a lot of them on twitch   After this experience I honestly fear for what others might do This guy turned out to be pretty obsessed with me it seemed Told me he loved me loved my streams didnt wanna see bad things happen to me that it hurt him when I was like this etc So to avoid ever causing this sort of pain again in someone I will limit myself from being quite as open and forthcoming about the issues I feel for the sake of making sure others dont hurt as well   I realize this was a oneoff case 99999 of people would never react this way and never have in the past but its important as a streamer to remember that some people really do not have the same stability as you and to remember your words can actually cost people their lives   Its been 2 days since I heard from him but just heard from him tonight Hes going to be seeing a psychologist he was in inpatient for the last two days being held for a psych eval and I really hope he gets the help he needs  I wanted to share this story mostly to pass along the message to other streamers that some people some less stable people really will go full on psycho fan mode even for a smaller streamer And being mindful of how your words can be perceived by viewers may help save a life in the future
257,If i want to watch CS:GO i dont want to see someone with 20k viewers gamble or 50 Viewbotting russian females I want to watch legitimate streams who share their gameplay not gambling
258,Streaming is a tough business  As an upandcoming streamer looking to go fulltime how do you continue to grow your community? Differentiate your content? Avoid burnout?  And as an alreadyfulltime streamer how can you ensure you do the same?  We wanted to know too So we asked 6 top streamers for their best tips for surviving and thriving as an upandcoming streamer or as a fulltime streamer looking to continue their path upwards Heres what they said:  ___  Annie Fuchsia:  1 ConsistencyStream consistently set up a schedule 2 PositivityStreaming is never a constant upwards rise Dont get discouraged by bumps 3 HAVE FUNPeople see when you love what you do  Note:   We cant overstate the importance of having fun while streaming  Theres nothing better than being around someone whos passionate about what they do Your emotions directly transfer to the emotions of your viewers When youre having fun your viewers are having fun  ___  Crendor:  1 Do it as a hobby first and see if it becomes something more 2 Take advantage of lucky breaks 3 Dont feel obligated to play popular games Play what you enjoy like Blood Bowl  What does Crendor mean by lucky breaks exactly?  It could be many things For instance if a larger streamer hosts your channel for 1000 viewers its up to you to provide your best content to retain those viewers If you have the opportunity to connectplay with a larger streamer take it and create a new relationship  Luck is where preparation meets opportunity So be prepared for these eventsjust dont expect them  also playing what you enjoy goes handinhand with having fun on stream  ___  Xaryu:  1 Find a Niche 2 Be Consistent 3 Be Yourself Be UNIQUELY yourself dont copy 4 Talk always talk about something 5 Have a Positive Attitude  Back in the days of Mists of Pandaria it will be missed Xaryu was one of the first streamers on Twitch to stream 1v2 and 1000 challenges in World of Warcraft arena matches His viewers loved itit was intense it was fun and most importantly:  It was new That was Xaryus niche within the World of Warcraft streaming community  What cool things can you do on your stream to continuously set you apart?  ____________________  MHeyhoe91  1 Set up a schedule  2 Dont focus on viewerfollower numberseveryone starts at zero 3 Play something you enjoy  4 Networkchat to other streamersbuild friendships 5 Have fun Dont force it ___  Andy Pyro:  >I think its fine to find inspiration from others Putting name tags onto ideas is not the way to go   Directly copying ideas from other streamers in most cases wont drive any real results to your stream Generating your own ideas from the ideas of others however can provide great results  Lets say you were a WoW streamer in 2013 when Xaryu was streaming 1v2s and 1000s Sure you couldve tried your hand at the challenges but you wouldnt be bringing anything new to viewers Theyd get bored easily  But what if you were to try a 1000 challenge in another PvP game mode like Rated Battlegrounds? What if instead of 1000 you tried to go 5000 in arenas?  Ok winning 500 games in a row is extremely unlikelybut itd be a hell of a lot of fun to watch and more importantly youd be providing something new  ___  Smexxin:  >In the early stages of streaming you have a lot of room to engage with your chat and have back and forth conversations with them Helping with questionsgeneral knowledge goes a long way  ___  And thats it  If youre interested Ive included five more tips on a full blog post I wrote up on the topic Heres a link: https:mediumcompowerspike23tipsfrom7fulltimestreamersonsurvivingandthrivingasastreamer4f3dfc244bb  Thanks again for reading
259,This will make my life so much easier  EDIT: Scrolling up not always works for me :
260,So i have a nice computer I dont use to its capabilities though as i dont really have a reason to My friend asks me to stream Eve Online for him since he wants something to watch and relax to I download OBS set up real quick and start the stream It was obviously really just me and him for a while chatting about the game discussing why we like space games so much   Then another viewer comes in he introduces himself and asks how long ive been playing Eve Well i had only just started that day so i tell him Hes incredibly friendly and welcomes me to the game Then a few more show up and to be honest i didnt expect anybody to watch but my friend Next thing you know theres a handful of people actively talking in chat giving me tips and everybody is really kind One was so kind that he donated me in game money a lot for a new player chump change for him Regardless it was heavily appreciated Then another viewer doubles his donation  I was speechless I honestly had to take a moment On my first day of streaming i had almost 20 viewers in the span of 2 hours and they were more than i could have asked for As the nights wrapping up im getting pretty tired and i call it a night By the time i had signed of i ended with a total of 30 viewers and i couldnt have been happier  Thank you so much to the twitch community who actively help not only new players in their game but new streamers and give an extended welcome Todays stream might not have been nearly successful but honestly id stream forever if it meant being able to experience such a welcoming set of people again Thank you honestly   [Edit: Formatting]
261,No matter the size of your audience whether youre pulling 1 or 1000 viewers you are making a difference Thank you for bringing joy and just know that even when you feel like youre not doing much you could potentially be making someones day a lot better by just being yourself Never give up and just know that you can achieve anything if you put in the hard work and time and there are people out there that appreciate you   Thank you to every streamer for making a differennce in many peoples lives including mine Coming from being a streamer myself and a viewer   You guys are what makes twitch so great never forget that
262,Two Jack Ryan commercials Two The Purge commercials before a stream started just now and changing streams and changing back just reset the commercials back to the beginning  What is going on?  This is excessive  Edit: I guess I wasnt clear in my original post  I am running current Firefox  uBlock Origin  ABP and ads are still getting through
263,I love exploring smaller streams and lets be honest a thumbnail is not enough I dont really fancy watching 30s1m or ads before I can see that the stream is literally just a static image or whatsoever Im fine with commercials but let me see the stream first please
264,For instance I watch FAR less Twitch now Additionally any stream that has the option for Youtube immediately pulls me away from Twitch  Refreshing the page gives you ANOTHER ad so anytime their video plugin breaks I usually just leave Twitch for another site  Do these changes impact your viewing habits?  EDIT: For those with adblock issues use the Twitch5 Alternate Player for Twitchtv plugin It will replace Twitchs embedded player in the page and remove the ads
265,Had some free time at work today so I threw together [a looping banner ad]https:vimeocom225310914 for Net Neutrality that I think Ill put at the top of my stream tonight Anyone else who wants to use it is more than welcome Its a Quicktime ProRes4444  Alpha file at 1080p 60fps so it will hopefully be compatible with a lot of stream setups OBS loops videos nicely but you could even use it as a still frame instead if you wanted Feel free to share too  Heres a [Dropbox link]https:u26487511dldropboxusercontentcomu26487511Net20Neutralitymov If that doesnt work try this [vimeo download link]https:playervimeocomplay790424410?s=225310914_1499893439_1a64ebd18ba0d2c13d906245c6ab926aloc=externalcontext=Vimeo5CController5CClipControllermaindownload=1 for the original alpha file Think you need to have a Vimeo account to download it though  Happy streaming  EDIT Several users mentioned significant added strain on resources when using the original file so I made some variations that ought to be far less resource intensive  [Heres a shorter 1080p 30fps version]https:u26487511dldropboxusercontentcomu26487511Net20Neutrality20Loop201080p2030fpsmov  [Heres a shorter 720p 30fps version]https:u26487511dldropboxusercontentcomu26487511Net20Neutrality20Loop20720p2030fpsmov  [Heres a still 1080p PNG with alpha channel]https:u26487511dldropboxusercontentcomu26487511Net20Neutrality20Stillpng

267,I was streaming late last night and as it says in the title portions of my stream were muted because they appear to contain copyrighted content owned or controlled by a third party  I am a club dj and I use VirtualDJ and the iDJPool plugin for my public music source iDJPool is a pool of music specifically licensed for public use by professional DJs I am a verified professional club DJ and their terms mention internet radio specifically as an allowed use  How do I contact twitch about this? I do not see a support or contact us button anywhere  Edit:My VOD was muted not the stream Also Im a strip club DJ and do not care what software you think I should be using Ive been doing it for a long time and make plenty with what I use thanks   UPDATE: Per VirtualDJapparently the iDJPool plugin used for content unlimited is separate from the main iDJPool service I have full permission to use those songs Ill be filing an appeal with twitch and Ill let you all know how that goes I have to go to work so itll be later tonight They also added a noted that streamers in general are considered broadcasters and can use the serviceso heads up if you are looking for a music service for your stream [The source VirtualDJ directed me to]http:wwwvirtualdjcomwikiBroadcasting20with20ContentUnlimitedhtml

269, Introduction Hi everyone First off thanks so much for checking out this post I am super excited to tell you about something I made My name is Alec and I am an avid programmer who streams programming weekly on Twitch I build software applications from start to launch within 28 days I have a passion to share what I know about software development and encourage others to get invovled and show them that with an idea and passion you could build anything   Try SimpleAlerts Now @ https:wwwsimplealertsstream  Im sure you have a lot of questions and I hope this post will explain it all to you   What is SimpleAlerts? SimpleAlerts is an open source streaming tool that helps organize your Streamlabs events by using meaningful filters and groupings As streamers we ALL know how important it is to be active with our community and give shoutouts almost immediately As you start receiving more and more alerts it gets harder to keep up with the onslaught of these shoutouts Thats where SimpleAlerts comes in  This free open source tool built on top of Streamlabs system huge shoutout to them for great API docs \m helps you by doing multiple things:   Organize certain events into certain sections  Give priority to events that need immediate attention  Show which events have been read already and which have not  NOTE: SimpleAlerts currently only supports Twitch login and has only been tested on Google Chrome web browser As this application is currently in beta I would appreciate any and all bugsfeedback reported [here]https:githubcomPixelogicDevSimpleAlertsissues This will help keep SimpleAlerts going   Organize Your Events On Twitch we receive many different events follows subscriptions cheers donations hosts and raids Currently SimpleAlerts supports the following events: follows subscriptions cheers and donations The current event list shown by Streamlabs shows every event within a single section as well as events you may not care to receive While this is definitely helpful I believe there is a much more intuitive way of doing this By selecting which events you want shown or not shown in each section SimpleAlerts helps you organize what you are looking at and keeps your most important events at the forefront of your stream Take a look at the demo [here]https:mediagiphycommediae7OTRjKY94fbu7kigjgiphygif to see this type of sectioning in action   Prioritize Events This was a pinnacle feature I wanted SimpleAlerts built upon This idea really came to life by watching large streamers constantly lose track of their event list If you have ever watched Dr Disrespect you have definitely heard him say how he cant keep up or loses his place during shout outs This is why this feature is so important Each event has a set of filters that you are able to apply to each section that will highlight incredible events during your streaming session   For example lets say you have your cheer event setup and you want to know when someone cheers over 1000 bits? Easily set that by entering it into the Bump By Bits option and when you receive a cheer that is 1000 bits or more your event will automatically be pushed to the top of the list AND highlighted yellow Now lets say you received that cheer event but something else happened and you have not shouted that person out yet Every event list has an option to set the Bump By Time This means you can automatically bump events that have been waiting for x amount of minutes to the top of your list At the moment of writing this post Streamlabs does not hav any sort of feature like this Take a look at the demo [here]https:wwwdropboxcoms3fde6nns1zw7q38BitBumpmov?dl=0 to see it in action   Know Who You Shout Out Everything about events goes back to the viewers These are the people that support you and keep you motivated to stream Being able to keep track of who you have or have not shouted out is key SimpleAlerts helps you do this with ease As soon as you are done shouting someone out just click the event cell and it will automatically go to the bottom of the list turn green and add an option to completely remove it from your sections list This feature gives you multiple ways to organize your events in the way that is the best for your streaming style Again at the time of writing this post Streamlabs does not offer anything like this Take a look [here]https:mediagiphycommedia3KXbhJTiHhvIJS4ukagiphygif to see a demo of this feature    Open Source  Contributing You read it right SimpleAlerts is a 100 free and a fully open source platform This means that anyone is able to get access to the code contribute features or even make their own apps based off of the logc in SimpleAlerts The reason I started streaming was to show others my process for building applications and hopefully inspire people to get invovled in programming and streaming it on Twitch This project is able to help you get your feet wet with web development and contributing to an open source project I want to see others succeed and I hope this project can do just that To get started contributing to SimpleAlerts head over to the [Github Repo]https:githubcomPixelogicDevSimpleAlerts to find out exactly how you can get invovled   Final Thoughts While these were only some of the awesome features behind SimpleAlerts there are many more smaller pieces that bring the user experience of this app together I have been so excited to share this with everyone here and I do hope that you find this tool helpful during your streaming career Again SimpleAlerts is still growing and is looking for constructive feedback from the people that use it Please feel to submit any sort of feedback or issues at anytime   Thank You I just wanted to give a shout out to the PixelogicDev community for helping me with building out this project and sticking with me as I finished it If you have anymore questions or concerns please feel free to message me on stream Discord or send me an email to alecd@pixelogicappscom I am more than happy to talk with you I hope this project has inspired as many people as possible and has shown that with an idea and a passion to learn you can build anything

271,Hi there Im KickedTripod you may have seen me around here answering questions mostly about audio setups OBS settings and occasional mindset questions Im a fulltime podcaster first and I love the Twitch community and try to give back wherever I can    nbsp;   So why are you making this thread? Almost every day this subreddit is flooded with questions about audio setups I got a new microphone but now I have hum Which microphone should I get? Id like to answer this here start a great discussion about your best practices and hopefully create a space where we can learn together  nbsp;  The Microphone Myth: Your favorite streamer podcaster or YouTuber probably has an amazing microphone You watch them day in and day out with their smooth vocals and say I want that too So as most of us did we went out and bought a nice 100 microphone got home plugged it in and realized that wasnt the entire issue Theres something more that we arent seeing or hearing This is the microphone myth Now before I go any further I want to acknowledge ahead of time that this isnt always the case Some have thoroughly done their research; Others have all the right programs they need to make their audio work; some even have perfectly treated rooms Thats fine Im not here to tell you to spend more money Im not here to say you need more than you think you need However I would like to be a cautioning voice that at least asks Do you ALL have the right stuff? In short your mileage may vary  nbsp;  What does it take to get excellent audio on Twitch? There are four major components to making your voice sound awesome on Twitch: your microphone your room your effects and your voice Three first three components you have major control over the fourth one you dont and making any major changes to your voice can take months of vocal practice Before you do anything assess your budget If you have 200 to spend know that up front Lets discuss each of these:   Your Microphone: The first thing people tend to recommend when you want to make your voice sound better is to get a nice microphone Hello Blue Yeti Dont underestimate headset microphones With most headset microphones you have littletono background noise dont need any additional acoustic treatment and you dont have to worry about boom arms and the like Summit1G uses a headset microphone and its perfectly adequate out of the way and low maintenance This might be the best route for you If youve determined you want to go to the next level read on   Finding your first microphone can be overwhelmingespecially if you dont have any experience with audio USB XLR Dynamic Condenser Omni bidirectional cardoid it can get overwhelming quickly   Many here will correctly recommend a USB microphone in most situations Theyre generally cheaper than similar XLR microphones dont require extra cables or audio interfaces and some are even advertised as livestreaming microphones Dont worry Im happy to make any microphone recommendations for those whod want it The ONLY drawback to USB microphones are that theres little to upgrade or add For livestreaming purposes this is generally fine and you can find a USB microphone to work right for you   XLR requires an audio interface to convert the analog signal to digital Please dont get a 10 adapter off of Amazon that takes an XLR straight to USB Theyre finicky often noisy and they definitely arent helping your sound There are tons of audio interfaces and soundboards that run in the 80150 range that work great for livestreaming In my experience Ive found a 60 broadcast XLR microphone into a decent 100 interface sound just as good if not better than a standalone USB microphone This is generally speaking of course and exceptions absolutely apply The point Im trying to make is dont be afraid to get a less expensive well rated and recommended XLR microphone and interface instead of a more expensive USB microphone   Condenser vs BroadcastDynamic Speaking generally Broadcast or Dynamic microphones are more directional pick up less room noise and are overall easier to treat It is important to note that Dynamic and Broadcast microphones arent ALWAYS the same but theyre used so interchangeably I thought it worthy of note Condenser microphones on the other hand generally pick up more noise and can sometimes have a larger range potentially giving you better bass frequencies or more sparkly highs in your voice Broadcast microphones are an easy recommendation for livestreaming because of their inherent features but Condenser is often used as well Those Blue Yetis? Condenser AT2020? Condenser AT2100? Broadcast All popular mics All highly recommended and rated On top of a microphone youll want a popfilter boom arm and shock mount altogether an investment of about 50 I prefer a pop filter that goes over my microphone rather than a windscreen that goes in front the big round black ones that need to be mounted separately  nbsp;  Your Room: Weve laid a foundation for microphones What microphone you get should largely depend on your room Hardwood floors angled ceilings hollow walls and hollow desks means that youre going to deal with a lot of additional noise that will be difficult to get out with even with effects and proper microphone technique Youll be forced to do a combination of two things: 1 get an insensitive mic with a low noise floor or 2 acoustically treat your room In an ideal world you choose both To acoustically treat an ENTIRE room it can cost near 150 Exceptions apply  you may decide to only do some treatment bass traps and foam panels in front and behind you in alternating patterns you may do some DIY treating with blankets packing foam etc But to go to Amazon and treat a 12x12 room well enough to a point where weve removed most of those echoes generally costs about 150 in my experience  and makes a huge difference Hollow desk? Get a huge soft mousepad I have the largest Glorious and SteelSeries mouse pads that cover most of my desk space That way I can get away with cheap 30 IKEA desktops Hanging blankets over windows ruffling them in corners also helps Ive even draped cloth from my ceiling Besides these DIY improvements I cant personally speak to their effectiveness  nbsp;  Effects I could seriously write a book about effects However Ill keep it REALLY simple: Denoiser EQ Gate Compression To livestream I have 3 computers One is dedicated only to the effects I put on my microphone Dont worry you dont have to do that Ive used 1 2 and 3 computer audio setups For beginners using OBS Studio youre in luck OBS Studio supports VST plugins Whats VST? VST stands for Virtual Studio Technology In short its the audio plugins professionals and amateurs alike use to add effects to their audio recordings What that means is that you can send your microphone into OBS add the effects and go straight into the streams with no extra pieces of hardware or software necessary The upside? Ease of use Simple The downside? A little tedious to set up You cant know well how you sound until youve set everything up do a quick 5sec recording and make adjustments again Its tedious Another option you have is using software routing to run your microphone through a DAW Digital Audio Workstation like Adobe Audition Pro Tools or Reaper This gives you access to monitoring which will let you hear how your microphone sounds in real time Ill talk about why this may be important in part 4 To use these programs as an input into your livestreaming program youll need a program like Virtual Audio Cables ugh or VoiceMeter Banana less ugh but still ugh Software audio routing will introduce latency potential degradation in quality and can sometimes be a bit finicky Again YMMV With a two or 3 computer setup you can set up hardware audio routing but thats getting a little intense and this post is getting long   A denoiser is designed to reduce or remove your noise floor OBS Studio has one stock called a Noise Suppressor Its good Use it Dont overuse it Do this FIRST in your chain   Second in your effects chain use an EQ Equalizer this is where you can boost your bass cut your high frequencies or do whatever else you want to make your voice sound great I love the sound of bass in my voice and probably have added too much of it on my Twitch  if youre newer add 20 less bass than you think sounds best Theres a good chance youve set it too high   Third I use a Noise Gate A compressor is generally used to eliminate variances between the loudest and quietest portions of your voice If you add a gate afterwards youll not cut out enough or cut out too much A noise gate is exactly what it sounds like it mutes your microphone when the noise is below a certain threshold and opens the gate when your voice goes above it I recommend low attacks and releases here but youll just have to play around with it   Lastly a compressor A compressor reduces the difference between the loudest and quietest portions of your voice At least thats the most generic one sentence definition I can give it The main features of a compressor is the compression ratio Unless you know what youre doing never go over a 4:1 ratio as a best practice Play around with the rest  nbsp;  Your Voice: Theres a myth out there that to get a great sounding tone from your voice that you need to have the right voice for it You dont To be a professional voice actor sure To be that guy in movie trailers? Absolutely But to have a pleasant sounding voice on Twitch you just need a decent microphone a basically treated room a few basic effects to bring out the best parts of your voice while minimizing the worst parts and a little microphone technique Im told ALL THE TIME that my voice sounds amazing I sound like Im in commercials etc It happens so much that my Twitch community spams KTnicemic in chat whenever someone comments on it in game Speak to me in real life youd never think theres anything special about it So here are a few of my tips: First the closer you can get to your microphone the warmer your voice will be If you go further than 56 inches away from the microphone and dont have an amazing microphone setup with great sound treatment youre going to reintroduce echo by turning up the gain too high Second if you can use realtime monitoring of your voice posteffects Hearing how you sound can help you FIX poor technique intonations etc Youll learn when to lean off the microphone when you yell or are using plosive sounds and when to lean in close  nbsp;  Conclusion: WOOFTA I didnt expect to write this long But it illustrates my point: just a microphone is normally not enough Invest a little bit extra into these other topics and youll differentiate your stream with the audio quality Please feel free to like and discuss Im also available if you might have any questions  nbsp;  Edit 1: Like a bonehead a I misused cardoid when I meant condenser Fixed   Edit 2: I expected this but there are a LOT of people coming in and doing exactly what I was trying to avoid: recommending microphones as THE solution to your audio problems and overcomplicating this post This is not the ONLY way to do things Some people will live and die by hardware routing complicated signal chains extra steps My goal was to give ANY Twitch user a base to begin thinking about their audio where to start and general rules of thumb that took some of us years to know and understand I hope that can be appreciated Id happily do an Advanced Guide if people were interested
272,Hey Everyone  I decided to provide a fairly comprehensive guide for those who are interested in streaming and how to start  Itll cover a large variety of topics with a lot of suggestions based on my observations and advice Ive been provided by streamers It is for anyone who plans to use OBS Xsplit is a different beast and I am unfamiliar with it So before we begin buckle up put on your helmet and get your travel mug cause were going for a rip   Creating Your Channel  1 Coming Up With A Name: Like any product you want something that is catchy simple and memorable Also for those who really want to roll with it you can have a theme Your name is important because it really sets you up for having solid branding for your channel Some people just make a channel and their username is something unoriginal or unattractive Jdawg2245 or JackDavies or something along those lines You are trying to diversify yourself in this highly competitive market so give thought to your channel name because it sets the stage for a lot of future decisions   2 Catch Phrases: It may sound silly but catch phrases are a big deal in this industry They create branding and they create a sense of familiarity for fansviewers to recognize a channel CohhCarnage for example has his Good Show when he receives a sub or for Ezekiel_III he not only has a whole spiel he also has a thing he does that is a unique fist bump for when he gets a new sub For myself when someone followers I say Welcome to the Moose Squad Im Canadian so I felt utilizing that helped play on my nationality but also was interesting because  well Moose are pretty badass The Moose also opens up a lot of branding opportunities Coming up with your own catch phrase will make people get excited in your channel they will look forward to your catch phrase and hell theyll say it themselves when talking with fellow viewers  3 Schedule: Before you stream know when you plan to stream This is important in order to provide a concrete cut and dry timeline of when youll be online This is important for viewer retention Stream consistently for generating regular viewers as they cant come to watch if theres nothing to watch On the flip side dont stream too much or youll burn yourself out or have no new content Keep it healthy and keep it consistent    Hardware  This is the most discussed part of streaming each persons setup is unique and its difficult to say there is a perfect setup What Im going to do instead is explain to you the necessity of each component and how its critical to the stream and your viewers experience   1 CPU: The CPU or Processor is probably the most important aspect regarding the technical side of streaming If you are using a 1 PC streaming setup not only is it running the game it is encoding your content as it broadcasts to Twitch What is Encoding? Encoding is the process of converting the media content that you are uploading In this case audiovisual content and converting it into a standard that Twitch will receive Encoding is CPU intensive uses a lot of CPU power and this means you need a fairly decent CPU I recommend some of the higher end CPUs in order to give yourself both sufficient processing power and also some longevity Buying an introductory processor will only mean you get a short time frame of which to utilize it Higher end AMDIntel processors will allow you to get the most for your money because even though its 100 more it may last another 2 years until needing to upgrade   2 GPU: Your GPU or video card is essential in running the games that you are playing The two major players are AMD and nVidia The better your GPU the better your graphics will be and the higher quality your stream will be because of how the game looks Unless your using the nVidia nvenc encoder the GPU isnt super critical on the stream technical side of things mainly just on the game side   3 RAM: Your RAM or memory is all about short term memory the minimum I would recommend is 8GB but I highly recommend 16GB or more as Open World games and Survival games are utilizing more since they are temporarily storing data from servers in your RAM client side in order to display it on your machine RAM significantly helps with multitasking as you start to run a few applications at the same time while you stream   4 HDDSSD: Your HDD Hard Drive Disk or SSD Solid State Drive are all about storage SSDs are great for storing all your main programs and OS on and running from there and using a HDD for storing data is handy HDD utilize mechanical components in order to run therefore increasing the odds of fairly so if your data is important to you have a backup that is typically a bit larger than your current hard drive in order to make sure ALL your content is backed up SSDs use flash memory the same as Thumb Drives and this allows them to be faster and more reliable as the odds of mechanical failure are slim to none If you are looking to edit your content on your computer make sure to have a decent sized HDD so that you can record your stream as you stream it  5 Monitors: Monitors become your best friend as your stream grows I currently use 3 monitors I know right? Im insane but this allows me to have the center monitor act as my main action monitor the game Im playing my left monitor is my OBS screen so I can check my frames uptime and see any alerts that are broadcast more on this later ;] finally my right monitor is for my botchat client I use Ankhbot again more on this later  6 Webcam: If you are deciding to use a webcam its worth getting a decent one right off the bat A nice logitech webcam is under 100 but should last you for a couple years  7 Microphone: This is a more difficult decision Each person has a different way they want to broadcast their audio to their viewers Many just use a headset and eventually upgrade to something else once theyve established themselves Others will use something with more umph right from the get go like a Razer Seiren or a Blue Micophones  Yeti Mic And even higher this includes myself people will use a digital audio input use a high end studio microphone and a scissor stand to record professional quality sound with more options for effects and the like   8 Network: It is important that you have ~5mbps upload speed This will allow you to upload at the recommended encoding bitrate of 2000kbps   9 Capture Card: for those of you who want to stream console games a capture card is important There are a variety of capture cards for old connections and for HDMI You also have the option of internal or external capture devices This will reduce the load on your PC as the processor is being used just for encoding as the game is being played on the console Search for the right capture card for you and see how it goes  10 Peripheral: This includes mice keyboard etc This doesnt have a major impact on the stream just get what you like and makes gameplay more comfortable for you    Setting Up OBS  1 First [download OBS]https:obsprojectcom this is the application that this guide is based off of and while allow you to broad cast your stream to your twitch channel   2 Second download [CLR Browser]https:obsprojectcomforumresourcesclrbrowsersourceplugin22 this is important to providing your channel with Alerts and other similar addons for notifications   3 Third follow the instructions to install both of them in order to have your OBS installed with the CLR Browser Plugin   4 Fourth go to your Twitch Dashboard go to Stream Key and show your stream key This is important for OBS to broadcast to your Twitch channel Go to your OBS SettingsBroadcast Settings and input your stream key into the Play PathStream Key section when youve set Mode to Live Stream and Streaming Service to Twitch   5 Fifth set your encoding bitrate The golden rule for a nonpartnered streamer is around 2000kbps for your Bitrate Make sure you are using CBR and I personally use the x264 encoder   6 Sixth set your video settings The golden rule is 1280x720 720P with an FPS of 30   7 Seventh set your Audio settings to how you like them desktop audio device and what you want your default microphone to be I personally have a higher quality stereo microphone so I force my Microphone to Mono   8 Eighth start creating your scenes There are two different squares youll see Scenes and Sources Scenes are the unique scenes for say Stream Starting Main Overlay BRB Stream Ending Sources are the things that are added together to make a scene This includes images for overlays graphics CLR Browsers for alertsnotifications Text Webcam etc   9 Ninth do a test stream This is important for you to gauge if your quality settings are at the right place for you and allows you to fine tune them    Branding  1 Logo: Your logo is your face Find something professional but at the same time catches the eye and helps draw a theme for you   2 Overlays: Whether you buy them online have someone make them or make them yourself overlays help enhance your stream scene Keep it simple while still adding flair Recently I removed some stuff from mine so there was more game space for what I am playing while still displaying the same information for viewers regarding latest follower donation etc   3 Information Panels: On your channel you have information panels at the bottom Use them to your advantage I highly recommend having a schedule panel links to your various social media etc Creating your own panels that match your general theme are worth it to create that Branding we are aiming for You are a product you dont want crappy packaging   4 Social Media: Try and match all your social media to your channel name This breeds familiarity with all the folks you are networking with They will recognize the name across all different social media platforms Reddit Twitch Twitter Facebook Youtube etc    Streaming The Good Part This is going to be general tips to help you on your path to becoming a great entertainer Theres ALWAYS room for improvement even the best streamers and entertainers have room for improvement  1 Dont be quiet: Talk to your viewers whether its 0 or 100 Talk to yourself talk about what your doing talk about the song just go full blown ADHD and keep up the pace Not only will this provide content and dialogue itll help you workout your vocal cords so that you can talk for extended periods   2 Minimize off screen time: Try and minimize the amount of AFK time that you have If you are younger let your parents know you are streaming Explain to them what youre doing and hopefully they understand Let them know how long youll usually stream for and if they absolutely need something to let you know before hand or via a text message Nothing is worse than Mom busting in telling you to take your underwear out of the bathroom   3 Dont play oversaturated games: Try to avoid what I call the Top 4 LoL Dota2 CS:GO Hearthstone unless you are REALLY good at those games They are competitive games and you are competing with professionals of those games and giant tournaments Try to stream games that are around 5003K viewers unless it is only one broadcaster with that many viewers   4 Dont call out lurkers: Dont even get your bots to do it Its tacky and WILL make most people leave Some people just want to sit back and see how you are Theyre trialing you out and you dont want a BUY MY ALBUM mid song   5 Dont ask for donations: This can come across as pathetic to some people By all means have a donation goal for whatever you are aiming for just dont ask   6 Be Confident: People like seeing someone whos comfortable confident and knows what they are doing or if you dont Fake it until you make it  7 Network Network Network: The best way to network imo is to support other streamers and organically support their endeavours What do I mean by organic? I mean dont force it Find streamers you actually like and enjoy who are around your size and show your support because you care about THEIR stream not just yours Eventually youll see the favour returned   8 Create Channel Competitions: These can breed fan loyalty and help turn people from lurkers to regulars and super engaged community members   Bots The Good Kind Im only gonna list the major three free bots   1 AnkhBot: This is my favourite so some bias here It is entirely free and allows you to create a custom named bot and will integrate with Google Docs and save everything there in the cloud It has Song Requests Giveaways Bank Heists  which you can change to a custom mini game A Sound FX System through commands timers Currency and Ranks Quotes and more Underneath that all it has moderation capabilities for blocking links and language and lets you ban people from the chat console   2 Nightbot: A free web based bot that provides moderation capabilities song requests and custom commands   3 MooBot: Similar to NightBot in that it is cloud based Includes song requests and more   Security  1 Create a separate email that doesnt include your name anywhere This will create a divide between you and your online persona Batman doesnt go around telling everyone hes [REDACTED] does he?  2 If creating a paypal upgrade to a business account and make sure all your information is kept private Your address may be displayed when you purchase things but this will protect you when users pay you money and it displays your information I recommend using the Name of Channels Twitch Channel   3 DONT USE SKYPE WITH VIEWERS heck unless you 100 trust random viewers dont even use TeamSpeak Discord is is a new app that secures your ip to prevents users from obtaining your ip  4 Dont give too many details out about your location and if you invite friendsfamily I recommend not doing that so that you create an independent identity make sure they dont address you by your name Get a PO Box if youd like to send things to viewers without worrying about them get your personal details   5 Ensure your Steam Profile is changed to your new channel specific email If you send a game to someone for a giveaway it will show your personal email unless you change it    Suggestions?  Feel free to pm me or leave a comment with any additional content youd like added to this guide or feel free to comment if you have additional questions and Ill add to the guide I wrote this pretty quick before bed but figured it would be handy for a lot of folks You can also email me at phazepyre@gmailcom if you have any questions regarding streaming or any additional inquiries

274,I filled out the survey already before really thinking about this so I wanted to put this here and hope that Twitch staffers maybe come across this   I get it  I understand that Twitch is exploring new ways to generate income for both themselves and their streamers  They are getting creative and I dont fault them for that at all in fact I commend them for it  After all the whole point of operating a business is to provide an enjoyable service and generate revenue so you can continue to provide said service and I think Twitch has done an excellent job keeping the platform accessible and balanced    That said heres my problem with cheers; I have no incentive to buy them  The target demographic of people who are going to spend money on cheers is roughly the same demographic as people like me who donate to their favorite streamers  When I donate to a stream big or small partnered or nonpartnered I get: an audio notification a visual notification sometimes a funny animation a personal thank you from the streamer  When I buy bits I get: an animated emote in chat  Some streamers have enabled notifications for when bits or cheers are dropped in chat so then I get my audiovisual notifications and the thank you from the streamer but the impact is far less than if I were to donate  As an example I saw this happen several times yesterday: Someone bought bits and dropped them in chat with a message  The streamer had a notification on and thanked the person but the message they typed along with their cheers got buried in chat by emote spam from a new subscriber  Their message was off the screen before the streamer could even look over  That person spent 7 wrote out a message only to have it go completely unnoticed   Then theres the whole mess about how that money is paid out  With a donation the streamer can sometimes get 100 of the donation  Some donation setups have an option that calculates the fee on a donation and adds that amount to your donation so you can ensure that they are getting the full 5 or whatever which I like because I want to feel like I am helping them out instead of complicating their finances  The bitcheer system takes a cut of the money so if I go this route Im not even sure how much money Im sending to support my favorite streamers   TL;DR: dollar for dollar donating provides better value  Edit: I want to clarify that I dont see Cheers or Bits as an inherently bad idea  Like I said I like that they are trying to innovate and explore new options to grow their business while making it interactive with the community  My main point in this was that the way it was rolled out made it appear like an inferior version of donations  It wasnt clear to me that it was a beta because [their official blog announcement video]https:blogtwitchtvintroducingcheeringcelebratetogetherda62af41fac6s83r0fqwa didnt make it very clear that it was still in development  You could also tell they didnt spend much time prepping some of their streamers on how to set it up or how to message it so initially it seemed like it premiered with a fizzle instead of a bang  Several points that have been brought up in this thread have actually opened my eyes as to the benefit of this system though and Im actually going to start participating and see what its like   Edit 2:  Thanks to most of you for actually having an open and honest dialogue and not just jumping on the hate bandwagon because change is scary

277,I know a lot of Twitch users use this function when flipping through multiple streams especially when youre like me and on a networking mission Looks like with the latest update mute tab became mute site which mutes every twitch stream no matter the tab Thankfully I found a fix via [THIS]https:productforumsgooglecomforummsgchromeUxeVWuLjNAkZ0XLO_vSAAAJ Google forum  Enter this into your browser bar: | chrome:flagsenabletabaudiomuting | and ensure Tab audio muting UI control is Enabled AND Sound Content Setting is Disabled You should now be able to mute tabs as you see fit after rebooting Chrome    See Picture: [HERE]https:imgurcomapY9IS   Happy viewing everyone    Edit: Formatting 
278,Weve seen bob ross weve had power rangers but what about an all time classic Mr Bean? Twitch chat would also suit it perfectly
279,In the last couple hours twitch has completely removed the option for the Legacy site  http:prntscrcomhahtao   We can no longer use the older and admittedly more clunky site at all There is barely any BTTV support for the new site support still in very early rewrite development   I know Twitch has no obligations to provide us with a site that is BTTV supported and are not affiliated with BTTV but it would be really awesome if we still had the option to bring back the Legacy site at least until BTTV is fixed for the new site  Edit: For all those wondering what my personal issues are I took a screenshot comparing the old BTTV supported chat left side next to the new forced chat right side: http:prntscrcomhaj1rx  Edit 2: It seems there is a little confusion over what this post is about It is not about fixing BTTV It is not about fixing FFZ It is not about comparing BTTV with FFZ and any other extension Most importantly it is certainly not about bashing the new twitch site Most of us have been having a productive conversation about the current state of the new twitch chatUI and how being forced out of legacy affects us Please follow by example and lead civil discussions about these topics Thank you 
280,Just curious
281,This has been bothering me for as long as Ive been using Twitch For any other website an autoplay video is an instant click away for me Its an annoyance its spammy and its a practice that almost every respectable website has stopped doing already The only sites that still have autoplay videos any more are trashy clickbait and Twitch I really wish they would cut it out Twitch is a very nextgen form of media content and their homepage has a very lastgen cardinal sin right on its face 
282,Ill keep this short for everyone   nbsp;  I was streaming last night and one of my semiregulars was hanging out while I played some Rimworld The night before I mentioned I was going to be playing a different game but when it came time to stream I was a bit burned out on that game So I switched and he mentioned it and I told him why His response was awesome He said Well Im here regardless of what you play because you are awesome I was on cloud 9 the rest of my stream and it was amazing nbsp;
283,Amazonowned game streaming site Twitch is continuing to see solid growth according to a new report from Streamlabs which found that Twitch increased its numbers of concurrent streamers on the platform by 67 percent in the third quarter of 2017 That growth is being attributed in part to Twitchs newer initiatives focused on allowing smaller streamers to generate revenue from their channels through things like subscriptions virtual tipping and game sales  However the growth in streamers using Twitch hasnt yet paid off in terms of concurrent viewers the report also found  In Q3 the number concurrent viewers remained roughly the same This could be because it takes time for the newer streamers to gain a following and grow their audiences the company theorized Its estimating we wont start seeing the actual impact of the additional streamers on Twitchs platform until either Q4 2017 or even Q1 2018Amazonowned game streaming site Twitch is continuing to see solid growth according to a new report from Streamlabs which found that Twitch increased its numbers of concurrent streamers on the platform by 67 percent in the third quarter of 2017 That growth is being attributed in part to Twitchs newer initiatives focused on allowing smaller streamers to generate revenue from their channels through things like subscriptions virtual tipping and game sales  However the growth in streamers using Twitch hasnt yet paid off in terms of concurrent viewers the report also found  In Q3 the number concurrent viewers remained roughly the same This could be because it takes time for the newer streamers to gain a following and grow their audiences the company theorized Its estimating we wont start seeing the actual impact of the additional streamers on Twitchs platform until either Q4 2017 or even Q1 2018  Read more: https:techcrunchcom20171030twitchsconcurrentstreamersgrew67inq3asyoutubegamingdeclined

285,After 3 years streaming on Twitch and being a small broadcaster with a solid base of regulars I love I feel like I along with a lot of you have experienced a plethora of personalities and differing viewer archetypes while streaming  Below is a SATIRICAL list of the types of viewers I come across on the regular  Feel free to add to this is if I am missing something  The Die Hard: This person is the bread and butter of any small streamer You probably met them while you were doing your second stream ever with your horrible upload speed They were your first mod and the first person that had a positive effect on you as a streamer They will message you back and forth at ridiculous times of the night and are the reason you keep going on the slow days  The group guy:  It never fails They have you on steam They follow you on Origin and every time you start up the stream they want to play with you Hey man wanna play is usually followed by 8 other messages with the same wording spammed to your inbox even though you are playing a single player game with no multiplayer  The Emotional one: It never fails 20 minutes into the stream and this viewers is claiming their cat died and their older brother is an Alien from outer space Everything has to be about them They will suck the life out of even the most positive streamer They can bring the chat down very quickly and make streaming seem like a mini therapy session some days  The Voice Chat guy: This guy couldnt be bothered to put in the work it takes to start a stream and make it grow Instead he always seems to be lurking in the group chat channel in your discord SERIOUSLY hes always therewaitingwatchingand messaging you to  jump in voice chat cause hes gotta tell you something Every time your stream is seen as an opportunity to try out this sweet one liner he read on 4Chan the night before He thinks he has the voice of a golden god but really hes just a 13 year old trying to be edgy  The Chat Champion: This person deserves a gold belt They show up almost every stream and add to your game play and commentary They ACTUALLY WATCH the game play and are invested in everything you are doing When a new person joins chat they are nice welcoming and a positive reflection of the community you are trying to build If you have a Chat Champion make sure you treat them well This person may be one of your first mods ever  The Fighter: NO ONE PUTS THIS BABY IN THE CORNER They get offended by everything and usually show up to watch in between tiny bouts of anger and rage just because you said you hated politics last stream When The Fighter and The Emotional One show up on the same day its going to get interesting  The Troll: Even though you may not have the patience for them today they are there They show up every stream and are one of your biggest supporters but they can also cause you problems They want CXs in a chat full of 6 people and if you have song requests on get ready for the latest Meme Wave to hit your play list They can usually be calmed down though with a heavy dose of H3H3 memes and herambe talk   The game choice guy: BRO WHY DONT YOU PLAY THIS GAME INSTEAD Oh you thought it would be good to play a full week of a certain game? Well this guy will love you for those 5 days and then he will infect your channel for a week after He wants you to play Barbies magic castle like last week and HE WANTS IT NOW He is a master of all caps in chat and his Kappa game is strong He will also be gone never to be seen again eventually so dont stress too much about them  The Mouth: OH MAN what the hell was that play? Seriously dont make mistakes in game around this guy He keeps you motivated to get better but also loves a good jab at his favorite streamer Every mistake you make is meticulously recorded by his terminator like memory He will remind you every day for a week about that easy penta kill you missed last week He will make fun of you a bitbut its all out of love  The Back Seater: Ever heard of stream delay? Well this guys sure as hell hasnt He is trying to guide you to a pin hole sized Easter egg in Dark Souls and you are currently running a minute and a half delay They want you to find every little thing they found during their 8th play through but on your first one They will put up walls of text into chat that are copy and pasted from the wiki They will not accept defeat and they come from a good place They want to help and they show it by being your player 2 If they could they would probably jump through the screen and ring your neck for missing that secret door 5 minutes ago though  The Lurker: Always therebut never speaks He quietly judges you from his computer and says hello when you start but thats about it They are masters at telepathically mocking your mistakes and randomly donating 5 dollars once a year  The Rich Kid: Always enters chat like hes walking into a club with a fist full of 5 dollars bills Will you put a shoe on your head for a 20? If so he might oblige with a donation from daddys credit card He has a car and hes 13 and he doesnt waste time talkinghe puts his money where his moth is Turn on text to speech donations and watch the money roll in in small increments of 2 dollars or less  Charles Chargeback: He talks like firebut this guy is all smoke He starts out as any streamers wish come true A 100 dollar donation They make you scream with excitement jump with joy and then cry in a deep pit of depression and sadness two days later when they charge back and refund their donation SERIOUSLY FUCK this guy  The Specs guy: Are you playing an amazing game with a breathtaking story and awesome character models? This guys doesnt fucking care bro Put it on Ultra high or GTFO is his moto He doesnt have time for small talk He just wants to know if his dick isermmI meanif his graphics card is better then yours Just put your specs in the Info panels and he wont bug you anymore  The Shitposter: Golden Kappa test  Thats all I can think of right now  Id like to point out that I would be happy with almost any of these people viewing my channel People all have their own intricacys and differences This is straight satire with a bit of truth peppered in ;  Feel free to add to it if you think I have missed anything  EDIT: Add The Lurker  The Rich Kid Charles Chargeback The Specs Guy The shitposter
286,Another edit: my idiocy continues to show itself I misunderstood the payment receipt and I paid for Gift Subscriptions only Didnt even know that existed Can you tell I get on there a lot? LolOne streamer tried to find if he could return the gift to no avail This hacker knew what he was doing   Hi everyone  Title says most of it Ive donated probably once or twice and subscribed once or twice in my entire 4 years on Twitch None of which has happened for over a year  I woke up yesterday to 6 emails confirming my payment of all the above that occurred within a 5minute span at 7:30am~ my time in the morning  The payments have already gone through and am panicking because I cant afford this Ive already sent a few emails but I dont know what steps to take to get my money back in a timely manner Edit: Bank said yesterday they cant do anything on their side because Ive made one purchase through them so that MUST mean all purchases are valid Edit lmao: called again today and they said to start the process with them in a week if I cant get Twitch to help   Ive changed my password and deleted my payment information from the website to make sure this doesnt happen again Edit: and did 2step verification  Sorry if Im breaking any rules or doing this wrong but Im in panicmode and have utilities due soon I cant pay  Thank you for any responses   EDIT: also if anyone has any idea how long I should wait before bringing it up to Twitch again that would also be helpful Ive read about sometimes it taking up to 7 days for some people and others being ignored completely of course I dont know if these situations are actually valid I want to be proactive but not nagging  Edit: Im impressed you made it to the end of this ridiculously convoluted wall of text Everyone has been very nice and have given me some superb advice Thanks to everyone who has been trying to help me out Lessons learned: secondstep verification dont use a debit card online if you can help it   Update: There was no dialogue back and forth or any email updates they just put my money back in my account and that was that Thank you to everyone who gave me advice and helped along the way I definitely learned a thing or two about online security
287,Getting to rewatch Mob Psycho 100 and Kobayashis Dragon Maid again with 20k Twitch Chat has been the brightest and most enjoyable parts of the past week and I even got to watch a couple shows I havent seen yet such as Tanya the Evil Please do this again
288,Im thinking of making an app to help new streamers with their dialogue during a broadcast  It would automate the planning of their stream suggest questions news topics based on the game they are playing questions of the day and lots more  Do you think this is something folks might be interested in?  Is there any thing you might like to see included in an app like this?  Id offer it free of charge or free to use in exchange for a channel follow  Edit:  Really appreciate the feedback everyone  Not sure if youll see this edit but would folks generally prefer a mobile app or a web based app?  If mobile app android or apple operating system?
289,I recently learned that not all song on SoundCloud that claim to be ccby aka free to use if you include attribution are actually free to use The majority of the time it is a remix from an artist who never had the right to remix the song in the first place Ugh    Thus Ive set up a system to upload each song to youtube because of their automated copyright check  the song is processed and checked for copyright the instant you upload it so I know if it is good to go to stream on Twitch Ive found that the majority of remixes get flagged but small artists who upload as ccby are normally telling the truth because they arent claimed by YouTubes automated copyright system I delete any song that gets a copyright claim unless it is cleared later but I still put a warning in the description So far Ive been able to check and clear ~500 songs for streaming on Twitch     Long story short  Here are a bunch of playlists that Ive prechecked to make sure they dont get any copyright claims on them They are all good to go for streaming on twitch   EDM  https:youtubel2GhLXlPbVk?list=PL5SZDSwzcVQRbEW1m0k2X_uvp_sgdqHnt=13  Chill  https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=a5MENZ2Y1CUlist=PL5SZDSwzcVQTMrMIWbc5j11wrtQJ4_mC9  Chiptune  https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=rRmdoMHxLpolist=PL5SZDSwzcVQQJG0i11toTA9ysxXAHZOQ  Dark  https:youtubewU038ZVp190?list=PL5SZDSwzcVQTzH9x0EpUGjQXcnlBlL032t=6  Moody  https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=MD4aZ4Y_Fjcindex=2list=PL5SZDSwzcVQRis3_JD2ykTfg9VEV5RfVo  Soundtrack  https:youtubePPMG7_gP4Bg?list=PL5SZDSwzcVQRLCuIktocX6nfklgCUuq54t=8  Epic  https:youtube04FWRczpd4g?list=PL5SZDSwzcVQQiRIb0oT6J7St4m6v14FPt=67

291,I find a put a lot of energy into my streams I try my best to play as well as I can I stay positive and active throughout Im giving it my all  By the end of the session Im just exhausted Does anyone else feel this way? Do you do anything to combat this or is this just something you deal with?  Ill still starting out so maybe its something Ill adapt to in time  Thanks all looking forward to your responses  Edit: Just want to give a big thanks to everyone who responded I think I manged to reply to you all Definitely nice to hear the feelings of so many streamers So much good advice really appreciate it
292,   I have been off and on streaming for 7 months now After 3 months the first time i was getting about 30 concurrent viewers It felt amazing But i had a problem drinking I would miss days on my schedule Stop being goofy And at my worst pass out on steam or black out crawl out of room God Rewatching that vod really threw me into a depression       I had tried a couple times to come back but always fell short and messed it up       Well not today     I am today 6 days sober And i had a rough day I was going to drink tonight but instead i said fuck it lets just try to calm down through twitch So i steamed sober and even put that in my title       I had a blast I had other sober streamers come in and encourage me It was great       So thank you twitch for giving me a platform of encouragement  Thank you for helping me stay sober another day       I will continue to do this I will use twitch as a sort of accountability check And i look forward to 7 days sober And i look forward to my next stream    Goodnight  edit man i dont really know what to say Im overwhelmed  today from all of you Everything from encouragement to advice on people to listen to Bojack and even some one gilding me Thank you all  
293,Im sorry but you might as well mute your stream from now on Every single thing youre about to say on your next broadcast either live on another platform might cause your channel a perma ban  Its like saying you like Coke but Pepsi is crap then Pepsi founds out and bring you to court for you claim Then you end up paying a large amount of your own money for property damage or some other BS  Were getting pretty close to a State Police turn of events concern here  Might as well stop streaming on Twitch idk
294,If anyone needs more bits for the Overwatch skins Twitch Prime is currently offering 400 Bits to those who claim the offer of watching the first episode of Jack Ryan on Amazon Prime Video by September 5 with the bits being credited on the 7th  x200B;  [https:wwwtwitchtvprime]https:wwwtwitchtvprime  Edit: You can use the bits to cheer an esport team on the Overwatch League channel and unlock skins for the game  Edit 2: Got a notification on Twitch that Ive been awarded the 400 bits so check your notifications I only saw the pilot episode 
295,im tired of having to look at  Electricalskateboard and Electricallongboard and other 4\~5 bots now to look at my 1\~3 real viewer listis annoyingare they not against twitch rules? can twitch make a rule against them already? is it just me that dont like them?    maybe streamlabs chatbot or somethign can give the option to not see a user of your choice in the list?
296,As the title says Ive been noticing more and more lately that a lot of people who used to be big streamers are getting lower and lower view counts as the days go by and Fortnite streamers like Myth Ninja and Daequan are getting an incredible amount of viewers Especially Ninja who seems to rake in at least 100k people per stream   Im not against these guys getting viewers at all their good streamers and people want to watch them I actually really like it Any attention that gets attracted to Esports and twitch streaming are a good thing in my opinion and the Fortnite craze has been nothing but fun to watch with all these streamers becoming more household names and watching competitive tournaments and new game modes unfold makes for awesome and fun content as well I just wish that more of the newer twitch viewers that came because of Fortnite or just happened to try watching twitch recently for other games would try out watching other streamers Fortnite is fun to watch and I love watching Ninja myself Ive been watching Ninja since about 2015 because of H1 but there are so many streamers to enjoy when youre not feeling the top streamers   Just try checking out a random streamer sometime Maybe try someone youve heard of but havent ever watched or when a big streamer hosts somebody youve never seen before just stick around and give them a chance Good luck trying new streamers I hope you find some good ones
297,Alright so Im kinda new to reddit \This is actually my first post\ and Im usually a lurker on most websites but I felt like I had to get this idea out there to see if it was any good What if there was a podcast that was dedicated to interviewing smaller streamers of all kinds Seems like a fun way to give people more exposure and give viewers the chance to find a new favorite streamer I dont have a name or anything like that Im just mainly curious if this is an interesting idea or would it just be a waste of time
298,Just a post to thank the viewer who has given me the most motivation Ive had for anything in a while  I was streaming a relatively unknown game called ADR1FT A space disaster survival game if you want to know and as usual my viewer count was 1 Me watching my own stream to make sure it looks ok  Half an hour goes by and I see my view count rise to 2 Someone is watching  This viewer then starts using chat and we start having a conversation about random stuff drinks memes etc etc and this goes on for another 2 and a half hours until I finish the whole game This one person stayed on my stream chatted with me laughed at my jokes enjoyed my content and now watches every stream I run  It is exactly what I wanted in a stream enjoying a game whilst chatting with my audience laughing with them helping them with questions they have really connecting with each and every viewer that comes along These are my ultimate goals and I wish to have that connection to every single person that takes the time to come by and support an incredibly insignificant Twitch channel  Since then my stream viewers has risen to maybe 10 on average A damn site better than just me  This has given me such an enormous boost to my motivation and makes me want to stream more and more reach a greater audience and entertain more people Not just on Twitch though it has real life implications Im more chatty around people and can make conversation much easier  Its really amazed me that talking to just one person chatting with one person laughing with a complete stranger who has no voice no face just a username on the internet has given me such a boost  This is exactly what I needed and I have Twitch to thank for it  So thank you Twitch and to my newest fan youve helped me more than you can imagine <3  Sorry its a long post
299,What sparks this particular discussion from me is a dispute over what entails gaming content and the enforcement of this blanket rule of gaming content only being too vague and thus abusable For instance many streamers watch youtube videos in between queues in games or as discussion points for their chatters Technically speaking this can be considered nongaming content That being said its behavior thats well accepted within the Twitch community and most would consider it benign enough to be fair to let broadcasters do this if this is not the entirety of their stream  Ive spoken personally to broadcasters large and small who have had run ins with Twitch adminstaff Ive spoken to several members of the Twitch community that would have knowledge of how rulebreaking is handled by Twitch Im not going to name the people Ive spoken to Im sorry I know it hurts my credibility but this argument is going to imply that there is room for abuse within the system as it is now Id rather not have any potential abuse aimed at those who have freely spoken with me  Im not here to accuse Twitch staff or admins my objective is to provide an argument that displays the potential dangers an unclear and inconsistently enforced ruleset can have on the streaming ecosystem For many streaming is a job and having power over ones main source of income is a power that should be wielded delicately  First Id like to talk about how the rulesets for broadcasters are convoluted overly complex and extremely vague I have heard that the rulesets are so vague that two different admins can come to two completely different conclusions for the same breach of the ToS I have heard that rules have been so vague at points that certain adminsstaff would dodge dealing with certain issues entirely as they didnt know how to properly handle it Theres a nongaming content rule yet a music section a gaming talk show section and a bunch of sponsored streams that have only the barest of connections to gaming content Adding onto this people like Lethalfrag were given permission to do a cooking show at one point under the pretense that since hes a gaming personality that its considered relevant to gaming content  Next theres the part where women streaming in only a bra or a bikini were getting shut down but men could have their shirts off and do streams specifically titled Noshirt streams This wasnt amended until an outcry from the community Showing gratuitous cleavage is fine but showing bare feet on stream is worthy of a suspension culminating in the dank meme show feet seen in many chats to get an unwitting broadcaster shutdown  If you take a look at the [Rules of Conduct]http:wwwtwitchtvprulesofconduct on Twitchs site it might not seem so bad on the surface But then you read and see things like this:  gt;occurrences [of nudity] in game are ok so long as you do not make them a primary focus of your stream and only spend as much time as needed in the area to progress the games story  They allow games with nudity To a point there is a banned games list but its surprisingly light but only spend as much time as needed in the area? It sounds utterly ridiculous and completely subjective  Im not going to go in the specifics and extenuating circumstances of all the rules but feel free to peruse it as theres a few blatant ones Im going to move onto inconsistency and the potential dangers it entails  Inconsistency can exist due to several reasons Grey areas and biases towards broadcasters either negatively or positively Grey areas would be things like extenuating circumstances too specific for any ruleset to reliably cover poor admin training and an unclear warning system for broadcasters Grey areas are problematic but education transparency and dialogue between the offender and adminstaffer could easily resolve anything that comes up The other reason for inconsistency is biases and this is where things get a little nasty  If hypothetically one broadcaster is streaming youtube videos to their stream a large streamer at that they set an example to other streamers Its reaching a large audience its noticeable and so you see bunches of people like this you would assume this content is fine for your own stream But the actuality is ambiguous as you could be taken down for this type of content but you dont expect to be  much like going 5 mph above the speed limit on a highway  When things become ambiguous enough that someone in power can hold a bias towards you and then look up a rule and make a vague connection to dole out a punishment then a serious problem has arose This shouldnt be possible this is not normal of a stable system Its akin to how some thirdworld countries have tons of inane irrelevant and archaic laws that no one follows but are still technically legally viable Corrupt cops then use this to extort those unaware of these laws andor who are tourists without warning  When a potential for abuse enters the equation and were dealing with professional streamers who make their living off broadcasting it becomes difficult to speak out Shutting up and taking your punishment even if you might feel its unfair becomes the only recourse If a bias couldve gotten you suspended then whats to say your career wont be further impacted by speaking out against it? The mere potential for abuse is enough to cause this kind of reaction in a broadcaster Even if it happens to be a justified suspension the very fact the system has holes in it that would allow for abuse destroys any trust in having an open dialogue about the suspension  So this post isnt just me bitching Ill offer potential solutions to get the ball rolling  1 Clearer rules Youre a very large company Twitch it shouldnt be too hard to get a bit more specific with the language of your ruleset  2 Enact a better warning system Or one that works at all There are specific reports of the warning system either not functioning as intended or not functioning at all Saying It shouldve warned you is a failing on Twitchs side There should be no doubt before suspending or banning a partner that the person involved has had ample warning  3 Encourage your adminsstaff to have an open dialogue with the rule breaker to establish if the intent is malicious or not The difference between someone who knows theyre breaking the rules and someone who doesnt should be factored in Were human beings we make mistakes Im sure broadcasters would be open to talking  4 Have resources for your admins to take advantage of to educate themselves on grey areas A senior member with experience would be preferable if they have a good track record for fairness and consistency  5 Offer a way for broadcasters to appeal bans with no consequences for trying Being scared of trying to appeal a ban should be a worrying sign  NoTears brave rustlers RIP on into the aether  Edit: For transparency sake this has been resubmitted due to rules 2 and 4 being broken originally A moderator of this subreddit has said they would allow me to resubmit if it doesnt break their rules I have tried to sterilize this post of rulebreaking without hurting the supporting evidence points and spirit of the argument I make  Edit2: It seems this post has gotten some traction Due to me having to rewrite and resubmit rather than my first post working out off the bat Im pretty tired at this point Instead of replying to posts when I can barely keep my eyes open Ill reply later when Ive woken up There are some good posts here and Im glad to see more than one point of view voiced  Edit3: Im awake Im replying to some points being made Discussion is great keep it up Remember reddiquette and to downvoteupvote based on relevance not whether you agree or not
300,Ive lost track of the amount of streamers that break Twitchs Terms of Service and only receive temporary bans even after repeating further violations Many people are under the consensus that Twitch will not commit to a permanent ban towards the larger streamers because they simply bring in too much revenue to lose whether this is true or not it really does leave a bad taste in the mouth to see repeat offenders return time and time again Id venture to say that many streamers violate the ToS because its ultimately one of the most effective ways to get exposure which leads to a very toxic environment Often times the largest Livestreamfail subreddit posts are of streamers doing just this It seems to take a very very controversial act to actually receive a truly permanent ban such as in the case of Ice but even he revealed that he was offered another chance on the platform but chose to stay on his current one which goes to show you the leniency of Twitch Is their truly a atmosphere of encouragement to violate Twitchs ToS in order to gain exposure to benefit both parties? Why does this trend continue and is it healthy for the platform in the future?
301,Ever get asked by a viewer in your stream What song is this? I love it? And you were too wrapped up in an intense firefight and forgot about that viewer? Well No more I say  Snip Music track Text output to stream  [Snip]https:githubcomdlrudieSnipreleases is a program used to output the currently playing Audio Track to our stream in Text format  It features the ability to output the Song Title Artist Album and album art for:   Spotify  iTunes  Winamp  Foobar2000  VLC Media Player  GPMDP  quodlibet  It can also save your track history which can be useful to find a song you liked but missed the name of  Now how can we add this to our stream?  Well first I recommend putting it in a folder within your OBS Library Similar to how I have mine set up  [Filestructure]https:iimgurcomhaAe9cvpng  Notice that I have my stream labels folder in here as well as well as my logo for my twitch channel Having it here makes finding the resources much more streamlined  Now that it is in a good Location we can start to integrate it into our OBS stream as an overlay element  Snip Program Configuration   Start Snip   Located in your windows tray at the bottom rightby default you will see a Blueish circle Rightclick it  For this demonstration we will be selecting Spotify  Make sure the following are checked in the panel we are in   OptionalSave Album Artwork Only check it if you want to output the album artwork to stream The next item in the list Keep Spotify Album Artwork will save the artwork to a folder in the snip folder This minimizes internet usage as it pulls the artwork from our copy on the pc instead of Spotify  Cache Spotify Metadata  Display Track Popup  OptionalEmpty File if No track playing This causes more use of CPU but will make sure no text is output to stream if no song is detected playing  OptionalEnable Hotkeys TBH You may want this off because it is more of a Set and forget kind of program  Modify the Output of the text   Start Snip  Right click the snip icon in the system tray located at the bottom right  Left click Set Output Format  In this window you have 4 sections:   Track format t  Separator format Blank by default  Artist Formata  Album Formatl  For example I use:    t        a   l  This text is then forwarded to the TextGDI Module in OBS that has Font type size DirectionHorizontalvertical and min and max widths as well as wrapping  In OBS Configuration  Open up OBS and create an Overlays Scene Trust me You will LOVE it   Add a Text GDI Source and name it: Now Playing or Current song or Whatever  Change the font to one of the fonts you use I recommend a maximum of 3 different font styles across all of your overlays and logo  Check Read from File in the Text GDI Properties of our Now Playing Text  For the Text File UTF8 browse to the sniptxt file In my case it is located here F:Video LibrarySnipSniptxt  Now for a Bonus treat   For a neat effectClose the properties window of the Now Playing Text GDI Source  Right Click Now Playing And select Filters  Click the  located at the bottom left of the new window  Select Scroll  Set Horizontal Speed to 7500  Check Limit Width and set it to 300500  OptionalCheck Limit Height and set it to 32  Now your Song name Artist And Album name will scroll across the screen  Album Art Dynamically uploaded to our stream too??  You heard right If you checked the Save Album Artwork in the section above snip will generate small jpg files of the album art on Spotify  To Integrate this feature into our Overlays Scene we must first do the following   In Sources Click the   Select Image  Browse to the Snip_Artworkjpg In my case F:Video LibrarySnipSnip_Artworkjpg  I recommend naming it Album Art or something similar to keep it easy to find later when you rework your overlay  Done The Snip program overwrites the Snip_Artworkjpg with the currently playing song    Been there Scene That  Parden the pun but I do think you will like this next one While we were dabbling with the Sources did you notice in that list where the Image scene and the Text GDI Scene was also there? Thats Right We can Create a separate Scene dedicated to overlays and Output that Scene to a Source  This is what is known as Scene Nesting  Why would you want to do this? Well for one If you stream to Youtube and Twitch you are going to have some common Scene elements like your webcam or your Discord information BUT Followers and subscribers as well as recent followers alert boxes for twitch and several other neat overlay functions are mutually exclusive  You dont want to be streaming on youtube and have someone Ghost tip you 10000 bits and have it announce to the stream rightlets be real though Itd still put a smile on your face if you did though ;? Or maybe that new subscriber on your Youtube channel Alert box will show up on your twitch stream  That seems silly but It is a lot of work to go through a bunch of OBS Overlay sources in ALL of your scenes  If you have to Separate Overlay scenes dedicated you Youtube and Twitch you can toggle JUST once in all of your scenes and wont forget the one that sneaks by you  To do it is very simple:   In a separate Scene from the Newly created Overlays Scene Click the  in the sources box  Click Scene  Select Overlay Scene in the dropdown  And Done A Scene Source for your Scenes  This is not the only use of the Scene Source Get creative the possibilities are endless with it

305,Okay so before you downvote me to hell and mention how the company needs to make money blah blah blah just hear me out  Recently tw made it so any stream you check out it will run an ad before you can start watching and whats even worse sometimes when you watch a stream and lose connection might not be even your fault but on twitchs end it will run an ad as well e apparently for some people it isnt the case and its how it always has been my experience is as such though I didnt used to see an ad for every channel out there  You are watching a stream lose connection for a second and bam 45sec ad you gotta watch and miss out on the action because hurr durr we need to make money   My main problem with this is basically that Im missing out on the action Wanna run an ad during the stream? Sure make it so it runs when the streamer is on a break or something like it used to be  For comparison just imagine watching your favorite show only for it to be interrupted by an ad and completely missing out what happened during that time because the show didnt pause for you to finish watching the ad  It happened to me once I was watching grubbys stream and I actually interacted with him by asking a question in the chat guess what? His answer was blocked by a 45 sec ad I couldnt get rid of thanks twitch for the amazing experience created by your adsystem I had to play the vodcast the next day and find the time that I missed just to see what he said horrible stuff for clarification it was a 1sec DC that started the ad playing not the streamer himself  It also brings another point: well done on driving me away from new streamers and content and I am 100 sure Im not alone in this  When I open up twitch I look at the channels and see whats going on and I cant be bothered seeing what other people are doing simply because of the ads that run for every single channel I try to check out Even if you play the ad then decide the channel isnt what you are looking for and look for something else heyho you gotta see another one of our 45 seconds ad to proceed  Twitch you are taking my hate on ads to a new level I basically hate every single thing being shown by the ads on tw not sure how thats supposed to help anyone  By the way Im not saying to get rid of ads completely just make it so it doesnt get in the way of the viewers experience so much
306,One year ago my account was permanently banned due to a mistake on Twitchs end under the category of Offensive Username The problem was cleared up and I got my account back Yesterday my account was banned for the same reason and resulted the same way However when I got my account back I noticed many people complaining that they had been unfollowed from my channel   Many people being specifically seven thousand users My account was reverted to 1000 followers causing friends and viewers of 2 years to unfollow the channel out of nowhere  This isnt a ban related post but rather a report for this bug Im not able to get a response back from support    Edit: Thanks so much for the support on this I got in direct contact with a staff member and the loss in following was due to a bot wave ban that had an issue specifically targeting bots Im not too upset about it but really hope it doesnt happen to me or anyone else in the future
307,The issue  I took notice of my Macbook seriously sweating while watching Twitch This is to blame on how your browser tries to decode the stream It does this using the CPU which is way inefficient   The solution  Cue me looking for a solution to watch Twitch streams in VLC for the float on top feature I wanted to use to keep my stream in view while doing other stuff I came across Livestreamer guide has been updated to use streamlink instead   This guide describes installation on MacOS only but the streamlink bit is relevant for any platform  VLC 3x  If you have VLC 3x and dont mind using that you can play Twitch streams in VLC Press ctrl  n or cmd  n to open a network stream Paste the Twitch URL and press play You dont need the rest of the guide unless you want a Twitch GUI on your system   _This will always play the best available quality_  If you dont want to play the source quality stream follow along   MacOS installation:        installing brew      usrbinruby e curl fsSL https:rawgithubusercontentcomHomebrewinstallmasterinstall       installing streamlink     brew update  brew install streamlink       Dont forget to update your packages every now and then or just when streamlink stops working      brew update  brew upgrade  But I have Windows   For Windows people installation can be done using an [installer]https:streamlinkgithubioinstallhtmlwindowsbinaries they provide Youll still need to run the command as I linked it above and Im unsure about whether this version updates at all   Using streamlink for Twitch:  If you have good internet you can just run the following command; it tries to play the best available stream like VLC does       streamlink https:wwwtwitchtvyourfavouritestream best  If you dont have a good connection you can run the command without the best part Itll list available qualities you can use instead       streamlink https:wwwtwitchtvyourfavouritestream  You can now play your stream with one of the available qualities You can also use the worst keyword to just play the lowest available quality or use audio_only for just audio      streamlink https:wwwtwitchtvyourfavouritestream 180p  Streamlink Twitch GUI  If you like clicking on things instead of using the commandline you can download this [Twitch GUI]https:streamlinkgithubiostreamlinktwitchgui You do need streamlink for this to work   Why this works  So this works because unlike what I talked about above VLC or most modern media players can decode video using your video card If you dont think you have one you still do The codec Twitch uses greatly benefits from using a video card instead of the CPU and the decoding process becomes much more efficient Result is a cool and responsive laptop that streams hours instead of minutes   [Heres my system load with a FHD stream running along with 10 idle apps]https:iimgurcomC5Zl6rGpng  Sources  [Streamlink site]https:streamlinkgithubio  [Streamlink Github page]https:githubcomstreamlinkstreamlink  [Streamlink Twitch GUI]https:streamlinkgithubiostreamlinktwitchgui  [VLC]https:wwwvideolanorgvlc  [MacOS Brew]https:brewsh

309,EDIT: It appears that this tip has been disabled by Twitch for subscriptions via Xsolla I cant see any confirmation its been disabled for any other Twitch purchases routed through Xsolla though if there even is anything else you can buy on Twitch through Xsolla    The larger rgames thread is [located here]https:wwwredditcomrGamescomments63zewdpopular_gaming_payment_processor_xsolla_has with more details  Im not uptodate with any the details really but it might be something to look out for on your bank statements if youre paying for anything on Twitch and making sure that its for the amount that you agreed upon Some people are reporting that the tip might show up as a separate charge rather than it being lumped with the main purchase  Heres the main rundown from the other thread:  >Background info:    >Xsolla is a popular payment processor to accept payments via a myriad of payment methods They are used by Twitch Steam Nexon Ubisoft and more  >Tips by default:  >As first mentioned [here]https:npredditcomrRotMGcomments63e42mpsa_be_careful_when_buying_gold_there_is_a_new Xsolla has started to include a Tip to themselves by default for all payments If youre not careful you could end up being charged extra for no benefit  >This is a move by pure greed by Xsolla [they already take a 5 fee in addition to any payment system fees]https:xsollacompricing  >This being a default option tells me they are relying on users not noticing and not bothering to ask for a refund
310,Yesterday I was browsing streams and found this super chill guy he was fun polite I gave him a follow pretty quick but there was this mod that kept being toxic as fck saying various things like   Why are people in this game so stupid ?   I hate when people dont offer me a discord when a join a party not saying I would join but I wanna be offered   When people in this game stop being lazy and stupid Ill stop treating them like shit  It went like that for the entire time I was there  I really liked the streamer and I do wanna come back but this mod kinda ruined it for me
311,Im wondering how this works plenty of streamers who make a living off streaming by just being themselves and not doing anything that really stands out apart from the rest of the sea of streamers 
312,First off I just want to say a thank you to Twitch for the amazing platform youve created This past week a local newspaper found my Twitch channel and wanted to do an interview While nervous at first I agreed It turned out really well Please note the newspaper did get some minor details wrong All in all im happy to represent this amazing platform   [Heres a link to the article if anyone wants to read it]http:imgurcoma4BTCi    Edit: Why is grammar so difficult? Also not sure as to why im getting a good amount of downvotes Not trying to promote or anything just wishing to share a positive experience I had using Twitch

314,Its not working on VODs Is it just me? This morning it was fine
315,Well first off I help a lot of streamers on discord and its really surprising how many people are unaware of how many game devs will give them steam keys to play on stream no matter if you have 100 followers or 10000  And its actually a really simple process just keep in mind a few things before you start asking for games  1 You should have a email set up just for this purpose and it should be on display on your twittertwitch to verify that you are who you say you are in your email  2 Keep the email and your social mediatwitch professional looking    As for finding who to contact well thats pretty easy  1 Start by going to the main website of the game or game dev  2 Look for something on the site that says Press  Media  Contact us or a Press Kit  3 This will usually send you to either a page full of information in which there will be a general or pressmediapr email this is what you want  > Note: If they have a Press Kit page there might be a little form to simply request the game right on there no email needed just give them your twitch name and a bit of info  4 Write your email Nothing complicated but you should include a few basic things: A greeting your name and twitch name  on what system do you want the game why you want to stream the game your twitch and twitter links and a little thank you for looking at your email  Edit: 5 When you stream post on twitter tag the game studio the person who gave you the game they will show up sometimes and help plus they like knowing the game actually went toward a stream    Honestly thats it I started doing this when I had ~100 twitch followers and I got a bunch of games to stream some people said no that I was too small but after I grew a little I emailed them back asking to reconsider and they said yes and were happy that I got back in contact  There are also just some websites to request keys directly which ive had some luck with  Sign up for Keymailer: https:wwwkeymailerco  Sign up for Evolve: https:evolveterminalsio  Sign up for Doublefine Games: https:doublefineproductionspromoterappcompubpress  Let me know if you want any help :D Sometimes being part of a community helps or if its a co op game having someone to play with already might make the difference   And if you need help finding indie games to play well Easy list of games:   storesteampoweredcomsearch?tags=492  and: wwwhumblebundlecomstoresearchgenreIndie  and: collectivesquareenixcomprojects  and: wwwgiantbombcomkickstarterfunded30157378games  and wwwindiedbcomgamestop  and: wwwindieeshopcomtopgames   edit: Im really happy everyone is finding use with this : So I actually run a community of twitch streamers and game devs so if you want to join that to get in contact with more devs feel free to: wwwdiscordggvV86Esf   
316,Its really annoying digging through Global Offensive streams and having to sort out all the skin gamblers thats not CS:GO thats betting skins I really would like to see it made into its own category so that if I am looking for game play I can just find game play   EDIT: Lets keep in mind its not the people streaming the gambling thats the problem its the fact that Twitch doesnt have a category for them Theyre gambling CS:GO skins so obviously Global Offensive is the most accurate title they can use at the moment   Its in Twitchs hands to add the section for betting CS:GO skins or gambling in general that way the people who arent playing the game have a more accurate category to stream under  I do not agree with reporting the streamers for something that is pretty much out of their control 
317,Tonight several streamers were streaming at a Twitch party including AndyMilonakis and EXBC  They were told by Twitch staff to stop streaming  A streaming company with a party to celebrate streaming but any actual streaming at this party is banned  WTF?  rnottheonion
318,http:prntscrcomgnjixl As the title implies This is one of the worst updates Ive seen since I joined twitch back when justintv was still around Fix it
319,After 6 months I have 338 followers and have about a 1020 people that I would call regulars I have a lot of fun when I stream and talk to people so I try to stream everyday I actually hosted my first Tournament the other day and it was amazing I have some goals 420 followers and just wanted to post this So thanks for wasting a minute of your day to read about the small accomplishments of an even smaller streamer
320,So many of the mechanics are not followed and it is laughable Even aside from the first season where they didnt care about stars turns are getting skipped magic cards used as traps and even cards changing values during an episode  What a series though

322,Hey guys   I live in China and I watch Twitch during my breaks at work At home I use a VPN so its not a problem but were not allowed to use a VPN at work I went to use Twitch at work and got this site cannot be reached Naturally my first thought was that my work blocked access but it doesnt work on mobile either tested using 4G not on WiFi I enabled the VPN on mobile then it worked Tried again without VPN doesnt work Can anyone confirm?  Edit I checked the ol Wikipedia which states it was blocked in Mainland China last month However I was using Twitch without any problems without using VPN just yesterday Im currently living in Shanghai if thats relevant
323,Hello all It has been a long time since Ive written a serious post on rtwitch For those who dont know me in 2017 I was one of the people voted most helpful on this sub I do my best to inspire people to show people that you can succeed if youre willing to work hard enough for it Unfortunately most people dont see it as possible Gone are the days Ill spend 40 hours a week trying to convince everyone that they too can succeed There are just simply too many people out there with negative attitudes and I dont have time to try to help everyone; Ive got my own stuff to focus on  And focus I have For the last 30 months Ive been streaming on Twitch People told me repeatedly streaming is not for everyone They told me that success is rare; hedge your bets This is very good advice that I thought went without saying but dont throw your whole life away to chase dreams Come on now I really didnt think Id have to say it but seriously if you got 3 kids to feed and a wife its probably not a good time to quit your job and take up full time streaming Be smart   But after all this time I still stand by my original advice  ANYONE can be a successful streamer if you simply work hard enough at it   The last three times Ive hopped on rtwitch there have been at least 2 different posts at the top of hot about people giving up or quitting streaming Im gonna say my piece one more time here on this site and itll be the last time I write a post like this again for two reasons One anyone who is serious about streaming will look hard enough to find the answers they need to succeed; I did it even without having read this post thus all the information I needed to succeed is already available even before I write this which makes these type posts unnecessary And two I just dont have time anymore sadly Streaming has gone from a fun thing I did with a few friends to having to deal with growing pains as it transitions into a full fledged stream  including 100 hour work weeks When I first joined this sub I was around the 2 average viewer mark 2 years ago Now Im at around the 50 average viewer mark and still growing and things are changing rapidly   None of this wouldve happened had I taken the advice of most of the people on rtwitch Harsh statement and yall can kiss my ass if you dont like it but I said it before and Ill say it again; if you want something bad enough in life you can get it if youre willing to work for it   The people who give up are the ones who will never be successful I understand the pain of not seeing success I understand fully the heartaches of trolls losing viewers streaming to nobody I did it for a fairly lengthy amount of time My stream never blew up; and I never expected it to Im just not that kind of viral streamer I dont snort hot sauce or take shots for donos I dont wear a wig and sunglasses and welcome people to the slick daddy club I dont do anything fancy or special that would make me stand out   What I do though is have the dedication passion and work ethic to push past these barriers I watched every single one of my VODs that first year Not in full but long enough to find one thing I didnt like about how I streamed and take note of it to improve the next stream If I didnt show my excitement over something I was excited about Id take note If I missed an opportunity to mention something I was thinking Id remember next time that thing came up to talk about it   I watched videos on improv I read books on acting I watched 100 hours of YT videos on public speaking voice acting entertaining principles And I watched them over and over constantly comparing it against my own VODs seeing where I could improve   I didnt ever change who I am; I have always been just me In fact fake streamers really disgust me and they are pretty easy to spot I like genuine real raw engagement with people and Ive always held true to who I am in that regard But I promise you I was a trash streamer when I started I didnt know how to engage people I didnt know what people wanted to see or what my audience liked Hell I didnt even have an audience to figure out what they liked Id never watched twitch before starting streaming and I knew no one I had no community ins Id never met a game dev in my life I hadnt even really posted to YT before outside some small personal family video type stuffs  The reason Im going so over the top on who I am is because I want to demonstrate that anyone can do it 5 hours a day or longer same time every day 6 days a week Just kept doing it My main point of disagreement with everyone out there saying dont try too hard and give up if its not working out is the fact that these people are glossing over the fact that you can IMPROVE yourself Nobody nobody on this planet is just a naturally flawless entertainer Nobody In fact itd be silly to even think that To think that someone could just be born as entertaining as markiplier not tryin to start a debate here just naming a popular dude is absurd You GROW into that type of person as you work hard and it takes passion and dedication to reach that level of ability  You may notice that I keep mentioning work here Thats because if you want streaming to be your job you need to treat it like your job And essentially streaming is a small business You are your own CEO accountant consultant HR and PR department On top of all this you are also akin to someone standing downtown in a big city trying to tell jokes to passerbys in hopes of gaining an audience of thousands of people who will shower you in money and get you off the streets and into Carnegie Hall sellin out theaters Imagine what itd take for you to go outside your home right now and start trying to get even one person to stop and chat with you each day as you try your best to perform well and be seen Now also imagine there are 2 million other people lined up on the street with you This is streaming You are unbelievably screwed from the start  So how do you overcome that? Obviously some people do I did Im at a point now where I just dont even wanna mention how much money I make because it seems absurd given my relatively small size but I can say I no longer have a need to work; its been steady enough for about 6 months now to confidently say I can get by on it living meagerly as a single dude renting a room in a house But I CAN get by on it And this is just the start  And again I never wouldve gotten here had I quit And I wanted to Many times There have been many times I thought about giving up Days Id come in and stream and Id have 15 viewers and I was ecstatic only to come in the next night to 4 no chat for 5 hours outside a few his and such Nights where I was certain I just didnt have the willpower to keep trying But instead of quitting Id go watch my VOD Id go watch another streamer and see what they were doing that worked well Id study how they engaged with people What it was that made people engaged and looked within myself at what things I already do that garner that same level of engagement I constantly revised and revised I spent a lot of hours tweaking audio adjusting lighting hundreds Testing different camera positions I did far more than is even necessary honestly :D Most of the shit I dodid is a waste of time People dont care that you have a 2 lower noise gate they cant even tell But I really hate that small click occasionally from my controller for example so I spent 10 hour tuning up my audio to get rid of it Complete waste of time from a viewers perspective but I care And I wanted to put out the best possible stuff to people because anyone who is willing to spend their time and money on me deserves that level of attention and care Its how I repay my viewers they help keep me going and I do my best to provide them with the best content I can in exchange because they deserve it for making my dream possible   I can never repay the generosity kindness and sheer amount of hours though that people have dedicated to me I am forever in the debt of those who supported this dream of mine and helped make it possible   Anyway after 40 minutes of typing here is my point Work hard dont give up You can do it Anyone can do it Dont be stupid and sacrifice major things in your life to chase streaming but seriously I dont care who you are if you arent chasing your dreams in life you are wasting it Sometimes while chasing your dreams you gotta work at mcdonalds Sometimes you gotta cut back on how many hours of sleep you get Sometimes you gotta sacrifice your weekends or time with family to make it happen And dont think for a second this is the entirety of what you need to do; as if somehow your sacrifices alone will make you successful You have to work 10x harder than anyone else is willing to You have to do the things nobody else will do While people are complaining about how hot it is here in the kitchen I just kept cookin And as I look around now most of the cooks I started with are gone  In fact even looking back at my [previous motivational post]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments6oavlzyou_want_it_go_get_it Nearly every person who said it was stupid has now quit streaming Just go through and look at their twitch links in their flair Bear in mind most of those people were bigger than me at the time it was posted   The ones who agreed with me are now successful And this again goes to show you the people out there telling you you cant are gonna be the same ones who cant do it themselves and dont see how its possible The answer is work harder If you dont know how to work harder in the sense that you dont know what you could possibly do to improve theres question number 1 you need to answer What can I do to improve today as a broadcaster? That should be a daily question for you Doesnt have to be big And youll probably waste a lot of time just like I still do going down paths that arent beneficial Thats part of the growing process deal with it Just know that at the end of the road if you see no way forward and it feels like the end it simply means you havent looked hard enough There is always a solution Find it  As I said this will likely be the last time I try to encourage people here publicly like this I feel as if it falls on deaf ears in 99 of cases and for that 1 who need to hear this I almost feel it causes more harm to them than good by encouraging them to throw away their lives chasing dreams This was a dream I chased; I am passionate as hell about it I love it I love everything about twitch I love the spirit of it all I didnt get into this expecting to make it anywhere and nowadays it feels like Im in a runaway train barreling off the tracks I cant even keep up But I did want to take one more opportunity to counteract the naysayers here and say screw em If you are willing to work at this you can do it It wont happen overnight It may not even happen in 2 years of working at it every day But as long as you continuously improve you will grow You CAN do it if you got the strength of character to push through the hard times and stay disciplined and not give up  I will do a video on YT breaking down everything Ive learned about streaming once I get partnership which isnt too far off likely within the next few months before twitchcon the way its been going because I want to really go in depth with a lot of the things I feel people dont really focus on to improve their streaming Here Ill just say look in at yourself and see The answers are there   Good luck and good streaming everyone Have fun thats the biggest tip I can give because sometimes people who get so caught up in it being work tend to forget that the entire reason people watch is to have fun not watch someone stress and work Your job has to be seriously to enjoy yourself as much as possible Good luck mastering that one :D

325,If you are rerunning content then you are clearly not live and you will not be interacting with the stream there should be a separate category called reruns instead
326,Hey was loading the front page of twitch and the featured streamer triggered a malware gen detection by my antivirus  Anyone know whats up with that?  Never happened before and there hasnt been any updates to my antivirus in the past couple days so I dont think its a false alarm  Didnt even open chat or click on anything   Edit: DO NOT I repeat DO NOT DELETE FILES FROM YOUR COMPUTER VIA SCAN  More than likely all false positives so you will only do harm  Avast mustve messed up a detection update

330,Making friends as an adult has always been so hard for me you either have colleagues relatives people that look at you as a potential partner or people that want something from you Twitch has been the most wonderful thing in my life allowing me to make friends that are both men and women and different ages The best bit? They are all just looking for the same thing Its really easy as you get older to feel isolated even if you have a partner and I really think twitch provides a platform where friendships can actually blossom I realise this is a bit of a pointless post Just sharing Anyone else?
331,Twitch is finally releasing a new mobile app with new design new features dark mode and finally mobile streaming built directly into the app  > With mobile streaming going live is as simple as pressing a button Stream to your channel directly from your phones camera to the Twitch App  no need to switch between other apps  Im excited to see how it holds up against other mobile streaming apps It defaults to the IRL category when youre about to start a mobile stream You can change it along with your title in the stream preparation UI  The new mobile app is rolling out over the next two weeks for iOS and Android [source]https:twittercomTwitchstatus880142774594555904  Link: https:mobiletwitchtv  Landscape chat: utdrobbo confirms that landscape chat is coming back to tablets _and_ phones in about 3 weeks [source]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments6kaydolandscape_chat_on_new_mobile_updatedjl6t1r
332,Edit: Thanks to everyone for the advice I think Ive got a gameplan for handling the guy if he comes back and others like him  as they seem to pop up occasionally lol  For anyone searching the TL:DR answer is along the lines of:  1 Politely warn   2 timeout   3 ban    Original Question  Hello Folks  Ive a quickish question on dealing with awkward users in my chat after a couple of recent minor incidents  Basically a guy landed in my stream a few nights ago offered advice fine started backseat gaming not fine started asking to play with us awkward Sorted all the above with rule changes Learning experience lol  What I dont know how to deal with was the guys relentless chatting He was in chat all the time talking about anything and everything and I mean relentlessly paragraphs of text that just drowned out everyone else in my small community  He didnt engage with other users at all and just directed a stream of questions and information at myself and it got really awkward  A couple of occasions he said things that indicated my streaming style and game choices in general would not be a match for him So I made a couple of joke comments about maybe this isnt the stream for him but he ignored that and continued on  He upset several other users they messaged me afterwards because they couldnt get a word in edgeways and this guy just took over the chat lol  The thing is he wasnt deliberately being a dick he seemed genuinely nice although a bit of a 1upper maybe I dislike the idea of banning him or calling him out because I get the impression he is young or perhaps socially awkward and I dont want to end up making the guy feel like shit  I know hes just one guy and I could ban him from my stream but that seems unkind to him plus Ive a minor concern that he could 180 and come back with a new account and troll like crazy  If anyone has any advice or info on what I can do Id be really grateful  
333,About a month ago someone posted [this]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments7uutellargest_viewer_boosting_site_has_been_closed thread saying that the largest viewbotting site had been shut down by Twitch and that a large streamer they looked up to came clean about having used it and had quit streaming after hearing about the site shutting down  The lack of evidence at the time made me kinda hesitant to believe it since if Twitch were shutting down the largest viewbotting site thered probably be news about it other than one throwaway accounts word But 1 month later the largest viewbotting site is still up he says you can tell which one it is because its the one multiple people have been banned for accidentally showing on stream and I know which that is  Also I havent heard of any big streamers having come out as viewbotters which would be pretty big news that I think Id hear about  Was the OP just making it up and all 600 upvotes are from people taking him on his word? lol
334,https:iimgurcomHAQQcTjpng  This has happened before with another extension that was used for Steam inventory management: https:wwwredditcomrGlobalOffensivecomments70xofswarning_trusted_steam_inventory_helper_now  Best to steer clear these permissions are way too overreaching for what the extension does
335,As the streamer you are a Personality Entertainer Teacher Theorist Host Shoutcaster Creative Pundit andor Adventurer etc and you have a job to do Your audience is dependent on the quality of connection and content that they get from your platform Why? Because people consume the things that they get something from Think about it Why do you consume the media social words music videos audio you choose and use the products that you choose to? Why do you play the games that you do? Because you get something out of it You are end consumer and businesses are looking for your time attention andor dollars and they will succeed when they do more things that people like and can use   Streaming is no different If you love Fortnite great But you are probably just playing it for yourself enjoying a game while the camera is on and cannot hope to get an audience from it Nowif you try to have fun with Fortnite and make it interesting to watch then you make it about the audience You can replace Fortnite with any other venture and the idea still stands Make it about the audience   Oh why is Fortnite dominating the world in less than a year and [making more than 300 million dollars a month]https:wwwthevergecom201852417390004fortnitebattleroyalemoneymaderevenue300millionapril2018? Because it is giving people what they want and a reason to stay engaged with their game    Now START Pick the descriptors like those in the first sentence that you want to be known for start doing the things that represent that by giving your content some real planning and thought with your audience or potential audience in mind Your name is your reputation your content your brand AND your resume So make it GOOD Everyday is a chance to add to that in a real way When you shift your mindset results should happen quicker Do not be ok with sinking years into streaming with no results Twitch is saturated by people doing the exact same thing This is how you can be different You have more control than you think  
336,Bad news is: you cannot make people like love understand validate accept or be nice to you You cant control them either   Good news is: it doesnt matter 
337,I was playing Rimworld for fun and one of my friends watching me  and all of a sudden a ton of people started flooding in the chat and following I wasnt expecting it so I didnt know what to do so I kind of geeked out but everyone was so nice and I played counter strike with some of the viewers It was so much fun  Id never have thought in a million years something like that would ever happen to me but it did and it was the best stream Ive done so far Im at 39 followers now and its just an amazing feeling   Sorry if nobody cares I just am stoked at it and wanted to express that 
338,Are you allowed to stream your pet with a camera on it like a go pro on its back all day?
339,Theres been a few of these posts but I dont think the action of calling out lurkers is frowned upon enough I see so many streamers who are still keeping a close eye on whos in their chat and even some streamers that have chat bots to call out any new viewer that shows up Heres my take on why this will only negatively impact the community that youre trying to grow    First of all dispel any idea of having an autowelcoming chat bot Its a bad idea and only makes you seem disingenuous If youre trying to build a fanbase do it yourself and dont automate things that dont need to be automated  With that said bots are easy Its harder not to have a peek at your viewer list every once in awhile I understand that The best advise I can give is to simply hide your viewer count and try not to look at the viewer list You can hide your view count in your Twitch dashboard by clicking on the red viewer icon while you are live Streaming will become much more fun and natural if you arent worried about viewers  If you cant help but look at your viewer list just keep it to yourself The people who want to talk will talk and the lurkers will lurk Trying to encourage a lurker to speak is basically just saying Hey Im looking at my viewer list right now and I need you to speak to me because Im lonely Thats what I get from it at least    tl;dr: Dont look at your viewer list  Again sorry for the repetitive post but Ive been seeing more of this than ever and it really [grinds my gears]https:theissuesdeskfileswordpresscom201505geatspng   edit: I didnt expect this thread to get this much attention but am super glad it did I hope some newer streamers can appreciate the advise and use it well
340,Hey guys Just your usual viewer here I just noticed something recently that wasnt the best thingthe official twitch app is asking for more money per bit Now this is in no way Twitches fault I just want to make that perfectly clear Twitch has their own price for their bits and that is clearly labeled on their website   IOSPlayStore are increasing their price for bits so they can have a cut of what we give the streamer I understand they need to make money too and all but for someone like me who donates bits oftenthis was really sucky to find out Not to mentionthe price difference is quite alarming  Here are the pricing differences between the official twitch website and the official twitch app:    Bit  Cost  Website 100 140 500 700 1500 1995 5000 6440 10000 12600 25000 30800  App:  95 199 245 499 510 999 1050 1999 2750 4999 5550 9999 11500 19999  Now you can obviously see the price difference is huge Ive wasted around 100 100 that could have gone to the streamer because I was buying through the app I understand having the struggle of not having a computer but you can still reach the website on your phone browser 
341,Its a ridiculous method to get people to purchase Twitch Prime  Lets throw a giant blue button on top of the stream and every time the user moves their mouse over it theyre going to have to look at it for 5 seconds  This is sad Twitch real sad
342,Im ripping this from a comment I left another streamer slightly edited to make sense decided to post it as its own post and hopefully it helps someone  Ive been streaming for 19 months now I sat streaming LoL for the first 4 months to absolutely no one so when I got that first real regular it was divine Then the second then the third and fourth pretty soon I was getting 67 viewers every single stream after about 7 months Then I found a game coming out of beta and decided to start streaming it first on the final beta weekend then starting on the release date Within 23 days on that game I shot up to 30 viewers minimum every stream most days I had 50 in there I was in heaven Chat was insane I was pumped elated Id caught my lucky break life was good on the top I made a ton of friends got to know a ton of new viewers the game devs it was just awe inspiring to suddenly be the guy everyone wanted to watch I felt so good every day every stream I went out there and put on my best face life was good  Then the game died within two months the entire game channel went from 200 viewers to about 20 All these people Id gotten to know left All except about 2 people and I was back down to 810 viewers I straight up gave up on streaming mentally  I stopped streaming 8 hours a day 6 days a week Id miss days of streaming my schedule flip flopped around I my energy and motivation fell through the floor everything Id built had collapsed No more pms from devs no more massive raids to drop no more insane hype in chat just dead mostly I appreciated those whod stuck with me They were no longer viewers to me they were twitch friends Not the kind of friends you call when youre sad or go get beers with on the weekend but those very few people they were my one rock remaining in the barren wastelands of my mind that gave me hope to continue on  Then they stopped coming mostly  Sure theyd pop in from time to time say hi or lurk and leave As my viewership numbers tanked even further I would think to myself why even bother streaming today no one will be there But I have very little else going for myself in life I had nothing but time on my hands so Id still stream occasionally Mentally though Id checked out I stopped caring The tides of twitch had broken me and I didnt give a damn anymore  This is where the turn began   Despite not streaming as often Id remind myself of the times when I streamed to absolutely no one I struggled to comprehend even WHY it was so soul crushing losing everyone considering at one point I had no one at all Not even friends whod come watch I couldnt figure out what Id done wrong why Id been shunned by literal dozens of people Was it something I said? Was I not funny enough? Did I piss off the wrong viewer and they convinced others to leave? Even the closest twitch friends had all but evaporated My discord server was filled with spam from two people despite having over 100 members talking about league of legends and shit posting back and forth and spamming about spamming no joke  I never did get an answer but my attitude hardened I realized through all this time I was still doing this mindless task of streaming still turning the stream on at least 23 days a week and still breathing Once I stopped giving a damn about viewers I began to appreciate those few very very few people whos faces I still saw I saw new faces come in watch for a bit and leave Ive seen this thousands of times THOUSANDS each time someone comes in talks for a stream or a few streams and you think youre building a connection with them then they disappear it tears you up some  But over TIME lots of time hundreds of streams I noticed a trend No matter how rarely these people came around they still DID come around I developed an entirely new appreciation for the people who come into my stream My attitude changed I was no longer just appreciative I was genuinely thankful in a way Id never been before Each and every human who comes into my chat Im not just happy to have another viewer I dont appreciate them for being a number I treat em just like I would if it were a stranger at a bar in real life Strike up a conversation Introduce yourself Find out what they like to do find common ground like you would when making a friend I no longer had anything to lose and lost interest in growing my stream it was hopeless at this point This was around June this year  Fast forward to today I havent had less than 18 viewers a stream in two weeks Wednesday this week I averaged 38 I honestly could not care less Legitimately Not saying it for the camera not saying it to sound cool on Reddit I legitimately could not give a damn if there are 5 or 50 people in chat I dont care if my viewers dont show up for weeks I dont care if they show up every day I have nothing to lose Nothing Theres nothing I could lose that I havent lost before  These hardships they forge you They force you to dig deep if you want to continue We all deal with trauma in different ways and having everything you love torn to the ground kicked spit on abandoned and rendered irrelevant obsolete and forgotten it either breaks you or it makes you stronger I came out stronger I suppose I definitely came out less weak as a human I no longer try to put on a show for stream I used to call it that it was my show Ha shows are for actors and unless youre the next great actor no one is gonna buy it It was a personality shift in myself that shifted my attitude towards what my stream is and it could only have happened through repeated breaking of everything I held to be true  So story aside some of my advice Treat every single stream as your first stream Today youre gonna have 0 viewers Accept it you dont have viewers That means you got more time to talk to anyone who comes in Remember that there is a split between gameplay and streamer that creates the formula of what makes a good stream It cannot be 100 gameplay with no streamer interaction and hope to grow It can be 100 streamer though That just reinforces that original statement you are literally part or all of what people come to watch If people wanted to watch other people be fake theyd be watching cable instead of Twitchtv so know that this process youre in will be a defining factor in who you turn out to be as an entertainer  Dont worry either I promise you anything you build up will again be torn down Im sure mine will fall apart and Ill go back to streaming to 56 people at some point This would probably be disheartening if I cared anymore Since Im just being me playing video games talking real talk to my computer it no longer matters if I have a chat or not I dont need that crutch anymore Ive been without Its not as fun and its not easy but it is something everyone goes through and likely multiple times especially nowadays  Ive dropped a lot of hard and fast statements here that Im sure people can argue into the ground but so and so didnt ever fall off ok? sure? there are a hundred explanations for those cases and in the end this is an excuse that others can debate over I dont care I am just a streamer I stream its what I do and who I am now Dont care what others do or did or didnt do Dont care that its a saturated market dont care that Im not seeing success as fast as others I just dont care anymore and its working pretty well so far I guess  I dont know if my story will help you I didnt list every single time the viewership dropped or rose But I can tell you it happened to me and it does seem to be cyclic and that there is always a surge after the calm You meet new people You make new friends Then you have a whole new set of friends who move on or come irregularly But then you get to a point where like me I have 100 unique chatters over a 18 average viewer stream and you realize that if you pick up enough people who love your stuff even if they arent all there at once you can maintain solid viewership numbers and always have someone to talk to even if its not the same person every day or every hour of a stream
343,Now its permanently burned into my S7 Edge  RIP screen  Thats what I get for not having a 2nd monitor lol  Maybe ill flip it around and do the other side next    If anyone uses their phone for twitch chat I reccomend putting the brightness down  Has anyone had issues with twitch chat ever burning itself into a 2nd monitor?  If I stream a lot is that a real issue? lol  It certainly fucked my phone screen after a month
344,I dont know if this issue has been raised by the Vietnamese community recently but it appears that Twitch is being banned in Vietnam by Viettel Telecom one of the largest internet providers in Vietnam  Twitch is currently banned along with other soccer streaming websites  I think that Twitch is accidentally classified here  I was able to watch stream on other internet providers minus Viettel  Viettel somehow identifies Twitch as an illegal soccer streaming website  [http:game8vnpcconsoleviettelchantwitchkhongchonguoidungtruycapvaocacgamethukhongbietxemgiaidauquoctenhuthenao74633]http:game8vnpcconsoleviettelchantwitchkhongchonguoidungtruycapvaocacgamethukhongbietxemgiaidauquoctenhuthenao74633  For those who can read Vietnamese otherwise you can see the pictures listed all the sites that are currrently banned
345,Ive noticed through watching random small streamers they always blame Twitch for not advertising them when they usually play unpopular games and have a bland personalty Not all of them do of course but the ones that do dont deserve hundreds upon thousands of views for no reason They say Twitch ignores them and promotes the booby streamers and all of them end their rants with no one else tells you this but I will  Booby Streamers may lack a personality a lot of the time but they still have somethings that bring in viewers Bland complaining streamers wont bring in any Why cant they see this? Step up your game guys
346,Hello I have been a streamer on Twitch for nearly 3 years and I have been a customer of Cox Internet service for nearly 2 I have never ran into problems with them in the past and having them be the only ISP in my area I have no choice but to have them as my provider  About a week ago there was an outage late at night in my area I thought it was just a general maintenance or a problem that I couldnt fix through modem cycles so I just went to bed the next morning I found that my upload is capped at around 34 mbps when I pay for 2030   After a modem replacement numerous tech visits that had no clue what the problem was I started to do some research to see if anybody had the same issues I had Turns out a lot of people are having trouble with their upload speeds theyre all Cox customers as well  As someone whose working on a Computer Science degree I know some people in the tech area and what I heard is that Cox is working on not only going fully digital by June 2016 but they are spreading Gigablast there Gigabit fiber service as well This requires a lot of maintenance and may explain why Upload Speeds for many streamers have been absolute trash They see whose using the most data twitch streamers and throttle their data There also seems to be a IPv6 glitch that causes modems to block the IPv6 packets as DoS attacks and that may be making the network slow as well Either way both of these issues need to be fixed quickly as possible The problem though is that they are not working as quickly as they could be  MY SPEEDS Paying for 300 down30 up   Speedtestnet Showing false speeds due to Cox having it cached in their system: https:gyazocom9ef14596c29cf053cd8fca18d9283f00  Speedofme Actual speeds: https:gyazocoma1c77ed70718184da6c55893d9bf3a6f  Testmynet: https:gyazocom0e461237c9dd41b089c7983a59a8a660  Twitch Bandwidth Test: https:gyazocom7f8516231c3cff10300de411e0de582f  Streamers who are Cox Customers with the same exact problem If you are on here and wish to be removed feel free to PM me  https:twittercomCryWasTakenstatus714967143117414400 https:twittercom_daaesstatus713772337099747330  https:twittercomsamzorzSHstatus715037454441574401  https:twittercomThatoneTitostatus714283915658137600  https:twittercomThatRenGuystatus713217252439359492  https:twittercombakihanma20status713149576841039872  https:twittercomeGr_Gnawstatus709522887682736128  https:twittercomTheBigT22status709102360023314433  https:twittercomrichardbeustatus708072891061903361  https:twittercomGreyDybbukstatus705655365946347520  https:twittercomgastlichustatus705219159571890176  https:twittercomFizbanAlbritestatus705133764200902656  https:twittercomShinoBeenTrillstatus702727861933727744  https:twittercomDaebolstatus700897273257984000  https:twittercomghostlpsstatus701205096969932803  https:twittercomFullGrownGamingstatus715301951328677888  These are only the ones I could find I also have noticed a lot of threads coming up in this subreddit as well with the complaints of low upload speeds   WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP  Publicity can go a longgggg way in the modern age Spreading awareness EVEN IF you are not a Cox customer a tweet to @CoxComm https:twittercomCoxComm or @CoxHelp https:twittercomCoxHelp can go a long way explaining how you think throttling upload speeds preventing people from doing their jobs is a horrible thing to do as a telcom company DO NOT CALL and complain you will wait on hold and a rep will tell you heshe has no idea what the problem is and they dont actually know what the problem is so theyre not lying to you technically If Cox sees a massive level of complaints from people all over the country it can do one of two things make them stop throttling upload speeds or two force them to finish the maintenance quicker If you are a customer and notice a speed difference make sure you tweet and let the associates know They will attempt to send a tech to your house and if he finds something great but most of the time they dont know much either The ones that visited me did not know the problem and sent work orders which didnt help either so dont let them waste your timemoney if youre tech savvy and know your equipment is up to date AND REMEMBER BE POLITE MOST REPS DONT KNOW WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON  If you know a friend that has Cox have them run a speed test at Speedofme or Testmynet and see if theyre getting close to what theyre paying for DO NOT use speedtestnet as it shows artifical speeds   Make sure you file an FCC complaint as well if this has been going on for an extended period of time: https:consumercomplaintsfccgovhcenusrequestsnew?ticket_form_id=38824   
347,Twitch has an giant opportunity here since youtube is shit and i am pretty certain of that it would succeed
348,Some of the people I watch on Twitch started playing Fortnite and a bunch of Fortnite streamers are popping up on my recommended channels Theres also some that I unfollowed and some from games Ive never even opened up The only option I see is follow when I hover over them though
349,While browsing rVideos I came across a Steve Irwin clip and the nostalgia hit me so hard As a Swede Bob Ross was unheard of during my childhood but Steve Irwin probably took up that same space in my heart Id never heard of Bob Ross before the Twitch marathon but still watched that for hours on end during it because he was just so likeable  I realized that both of those shows are quite similiar in one aspect: the actual content does not matter as the host is the entertainment  And as it is quite difficult to find episodes of Crododile Hunter I wondered if it would be possible to Twitch to do a marathon of it as they did with Bob Ross  Now I understand that the whole Bob Ross thing was to promote the Creative section of Twitch but I still thought it was a good idea  But I also realize that the license for Crocodile Hunter might not be cheap I am guessing that The Joy of Painting was basically free since all the episodes were uploaded to Youtube which is not the case for Crocodile Hunter So I thought Twitch might Kickstart this concept to both get some money for it AND assess the level of interest it has with the community  Just a thought but I might be completely out of line to think Twitch might be interested in this
350,Im thinking about streaming it I play online on Battle Tetris Games can get pretty hectic but I dont know what the general concesus is My friend likes watching me play he used to be local pro back in the day Im not sure what the community thinks overall of the game I know it has a low viewer count  x200B;  Sorry for bad Englando
351,So I got 27k bits from a guy  he also sent a few paypal donos from  Online Business Source  when I asked how he got the bits he said he watched ads for 2 years this is the most money ive ever gotten as a new streamer  should I worry about him like using a bot to watch ads he also came in discord and said he was using a voicechanger because he didint want anyone to know who he is The paypal money also came from something called  Online Business Source  if anyone could tell me what that is it would be great  Sorry if its nothing I just wanna make sure so I dont waste money that is gonna get charged back  EDIT: So the bits cant be chargedback but what about the paypal donations? What does Online Business Source mean?
352,Yandere Dev finally got a response from twitch He talks about it in his video here:  https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=ZXbQfGyxGDM  TL;DW: They said no and will review it again after the game is completed
353,Hey there a few days ago I decided to help a few people out whove been DMing me seeking assistance setting up their mixer for streaming and for separating their mic audio for discord  Well without explaining too much I made a [video]https:youtubezCOHcDSNzk which covers the basics of what the Yamaha MG series mixers has as well as the basic setup for streaming and AUXFX SENDs used for outputting mic audio for discord as I said previous  I also go into detail on how to connect a secondary input from your pc to your mixer to use for separating either discord audio or music so that it isnt in the same track as pcgame audio  I hope this can help some of you as I know many of you have been posting around lately seeking help  Feel free to either comment here or on the video and I will try to reply to any questions when I am available  Thanks all  Edit: Posting from mobile so every 2nd sentence was broken  
354,So I started streaming in May and right now Ive been at 150 followers and an average of 27 viewers I have hit affiliate status and Im so thankful for all those bigger streamers who go out of there way to help the smaller ones And not only the streamers who have helped me and are helping me but the ones who help everyone else too its phenomenal to just see others help and put smiles on each others faces That is why I love twitch and that is why I want to grow and do good and spread positive vibes on this platform thank you all
355,I challenge anyone reading this to easily make someones day today  Find a small streamer with 0  1 viewersdrop in and say hello and have a chat with them  Ive been doing it all morning and realized there are so many amazing small streamers just waiting for someone to stop in and chat  Send some positive vibes and scroll to the bottom of the streamer list and make someones day :D  Have a great day and be awesome and if you have a cool experience or meet someone great share it in the comments
356,This stuff floods the categories and looks awful over half of the top 50 streamers for CS:GO are people gambling I can barely find someone actually PLAYING the game Its ridiculous I dont know why Twitch even allows streaming gambling encouraging something as addicting as that is so dumb They arent even actually playing the game its a tertiary situation where the person is doing something related to the game but not actually playing the game   Im also gonna piggyback off this topic and suggest allowing people to set the main language they will be speaking on stream in their profile thus allowing viewers to filter streamers by language
357,Hey everyone long ramble here I encountered my first group of trolls yesterday and wanted to share how I dealt with them to turned them into followers I know trolls can be really frustrating and disheartening but I hope my story is just another perspective that you guys can have in your back pocket as you continue interact with new people everyday while streaming        I was playing Fortnite and in a duos game with a friend I landed in Lazy Links knocked someone with a shotgun then proceeded to pickaxe him down really fast In general its a pretty bm move but I didnt think too much of it A few minutes later someone comes by with a Twitch username gaylegend[myusername] and just starts flaming me in chat I know one general strategy is to ignore trolls and move on but for some reason I felt really compelled to interact with this person     So I try to interact with him asking him if he was a player I killed etc etc and for the most part I just get general flames He calls me sweaty tells me to get a job that I suck at the game racism yada yada yada He brings his other friend into my channel to also trash talk saying how Im going to lose 90 of my viewers etc when they leave      Meanwhile the whole time Im just having a light hearted conversation with this guy thanking him for taking the time to visit my stream complimenting his efforts to troll me and even helping him with his insults My focus was to turn each interaction into a potential conversation and also show that Im not phased at all by his comments I eventually invite him and his friend to play with me and they surprisingly agree I send them my Discord link and they hop on Now at this point I was a little bit worried because the people in my Discord voice are also broadcasted out to the stream so if they start flaming me here Id have to ban them from Discord Fortunately they were actually really quiet so we played a bit and I think this was the turning point The guys actually said I was cool apologized for their behavior earlier and started following my channel One of their friends even stayed on the stream and subscribed I personally hope that these guys do come back into my stream and I can continue to have real conversations with them and maybe even influence them positively          This was a really interesting experience and I gave it a lot of thought I think one big thing behind trolls is the psychology of trying to feel superior and they get that satisfaction when they attack you and you elicit the reaction theyre looking for If you respond back with unwavering confidence and show them that their game isnt going to work you might be able to extract a positive response eventually       This probably wont work for dealing with all trolls out there especially if you have a lot of viewersactive chat but I wanted to share my story for all the small streamers out there dealing with trolls Ive heard stories of people making tons of accounts over and over to terrorize a streamer and I can only imagine how frustrating that is Maybe its easier to try to kill them with kindness or something rather than repeatedly trying to ward them off  I dont know       I hope this was an interesting read for you all If you guys want to see how I interacted with these guys send me a PM and Ill give you a link
358,Ive been watching a lot of new streamers lately   People in the 510 viewer range    One common thing Ive noticed a lot of them doing is using all sorts of crazy gimmicks to keep people involved in their channel and then spend half their time BEGGING people to take part in them      Some examples include:        Elaborate point systems designed to reward people for watchingfollowingsubbing but without any actual rewards   Bots designed to keep games running in the chat at all times   Huge community events that you dont have anywhere near enough viewers to support even the slightest bit  Theres more but these seem to be a few of the more common ones  and usually I see most people doing ALL of them at once      I get it youre building your stream the way you want it to be in the future and youre hoping the viewers come in the mean time   But it just comes off as super pathetic when you cant even watch a streamer without getting personally begged to take part in this stuff      Theres lurkers who just want to watch  Calling them out is bad   And among those who are actually chatting most of them arent going to take part in your events  This will hold true even for big streamers      If you were a bigger streamer I wouldnt care as much about ignoring your community stuff because I know plenty would be interested in it  But its kind of uncomfortable when Im 1020 of your viewership and you start asking me to get all the details on the event from your discord especially when you target specific people   
359,I remember some people had posted a thread saying that the phone would randomly turn of dark mode Its because if you shake your phone it toggles dark mode I had no idea till o figured it out today Maybe this was well known but I figured Id let people know
360,My first follower came into my chat at around the 5:00 hour mark and I was so excited to finally not just be talking to my self I really tried hard to focus on him and eventually he followed me  Im really excited to keep getting more although im not sure how I am gonna  EDIT: thanks for all the support guys This really seems like a great community to finally be apart of
361,Lets face it As Twitch grows its getting harder and harder to get noticed and to grow your streams viewer base   Theres a lot of unnoticed potential on Twitch and the only way to get around the consequence of Twitchs growth is to be smart and methodical in how you conduct the business of streaming  So in this post Im going to detail some ways that you guys can spread your name and grow your community in a viable legitimate and nonspammy way  Well start with my favorite: Twitter    Twitter  Using Twitter correctly has the power to not only bring back viewers who have been in your stream before but also spread your name and reach new audiences who wouldve never heard about you in the first place  As a broadcaster its important that you are cross promoting your social media accounts wherever you can  This means that its a good idea to have a link in your Twitch info section leading viewers to follow you on Twitter having a social media banner that pops up on your stream every so often and shouting out your Twitter account at the ends of your broadcasts  This is by far not the only way to grow your follower count Here are some other ways:   Live tweet during the stream learn from Dr Disrespect and the h1 devs  Conduct giveaways on Twitter  Do a QA  Once youve racked up a few followers there are also a number of things you can do to get new and old viewers back into your future streams:   Post a Going Live tweet whenever youre about to start your broadcast  I recommend you make use of funny or interesting gifs and videos in your going live tweets These days a simple image rarely is enough to catch someones attention while scrolling by on Twitter  Also If you give the user a bit of entertainment before leading them to your stream it can help big time for leading them to watch your broadcast you can embed your streams into twitter with a tool called kapsuli   Tag the developers of the game youre playing  Game companies love to see streamers enjoying their games and by tagging them in your tweets you have a much higher chance of them noticing your broadcast and deciding to help you out   Post valuable content  Lets face it: nobody wants to follow you on Twitter just to see your going live tweets   Form relationships with other streamers  One of the best ways to grow your audience and get introduced to other likeminded streamers is to form relationships with other people in your community  However you need to be sure that youre approaching the networking process with the right mindset  Its incredibly easy to detect when one streamer is only on another broadcast to leech off of the viewers of another streamer When viewers notice this youre going to have a hard chance at gaining the respect of potential viewers  Here are some ways you can form relationships with other streamers:   Share content from the streamer on Twitter  Hang out in their chatroom after your stream  Host the other streamer you may get it back in return  Use the collaboration section of this subreddit to find others looking to collab  Once you feel like youve begun to form a relationship with another streamer dont hesitate to reach out I dont know of anyone that wouldnt like to have some company while playing a game once and a while   Expand to other platforms  Youve probably noticed a ton of broadcasters now a days expanding their channels to YouTube Thats because its an incredibly powerful tool for spreading your stream  If youre not sure how to start posting videos heres what we suggest:  At the end of your broadcast download your VOD and find any funny or interesting moments in your stream Then make a short video of all of the interesting things that happened to you while playing  Doing this will allow you to form a short video for YouTube that potential viewers can stumble across and get an idea of what your stream is about  If they like the video chances are theyll decide to stop by your stream Just be sure that you link your stream in the description of the video  Thats all for now I hope you enjoyed this  If you like we posted a full blog post about this on our medium blog and we even added a few extra things you can do to get your name out  You can find that here: https:mediumcompowerspikeexpandingyourreachasastreamertherightway3939ab52605f  Edit: Just remember at the end of the day no amount of promotion will grow a stream that isnt producing entertaining content Thats whats most important If youre worried about your streams growth I highly recommend Bacon Donuts article The Problm Might be You   Edit Number 2: A great suggestion by domo_roboto of rTwitch Using Twitch Clips is a great way to get streamers to catch funny moments during your stream and share them with their friends on social media   Do you have any interesting or useful ways that streamers can take advantage of to bring old and new viewers into their stream? Let us know in the comments
362,About 60 people came into my chat all at once and started posting my personal info I guess someone had found my info and organized the group through a raid forum My phone number address full name etc where all posted over and over again  They called my phone off the hook ordered pizza chinese food and escort services to my house they threatened to DDOS and swatt and they posted adds on craigslist for my area using my info in the sexhook up section  I ended up banning a handful of them and putting the chat in sub only mode for about an hour and I called my local police department to let them know what was going on in case of a swatting scenario Surprisingly they where REALLY cool about it the officer I talked to took down the numbers of everyone who had been calling me and he let me know that they would call my number to let me know if there where any calls made about my address before coming and breaking my door down  The situation was actually a lot shittier than I thought something like that would be Being harassed and threatened by 60 people sucks no matter what but its on another level when they all have your name address and phone number  I feel like I dealt with the situation as best a could and tried to laugh it off move past it but it really wore me out and it scares me that there are people out there that actually enjoy organizing together to fuck with people like that  I guess the reason Im making this post is to just spread awareness and see if anyone has any similar experiences what happened and how did you deal with it? What can we do or are we doing about stuff like this as a community? swatting raiding anyways yeah sorry for the ramble stay safe everyone and keep streaming xD  
363,You know the episode where that girl is obsessed with her ratings and getting likes? Where everyone you meet rates each other and the job you get and the house you live in is determined by your rating? That is what twitch is to me At least the side of twitch that all want to be huge successful streamers   I was just bored reading comments and one person was talking about how he looked at another posters twitch account and basically told him it sucked and hed never be returning to view it again Then everyone started agreeing with him about this guys twitch account lol So ridiculous but hey what can ya do I know not everyone is like that but its a low key trend I see on posts about how to get more viewers etc Kind of funny but also kind of sad 
364,I hope this does not fall under the 2 rule  I am so happy for this guy who emerged out of nowhere As many of you all have seen GTA RP has become the new big thing on Twitch lately One of the players has really been standing out and that is the Sheriff on their server Eli Thompson  I think I read something about the community helping him out with donations to get proper gear to set up a stream Today he is streaming for the first time In just 90 minutes he has 40k viewers 70k followers and more then 1k subs  Just amazing
365,Im probably not the greatest person in the community to break this news here but after a long battle with cancer twitchtvalliied has passed away As many people are saying however he didnt lose to cancer The mark he left on the world as one of the most cheerful people Ive ever seen and the impact hes had on everyone especially me as a viewer Though I did not know him personally I know hes in a better place We are all praying for Allieds family during this time  https:twittercomfdotnystatus859259303592677376  <3
366,https:twittercom360Chrismstatus799080678029754368  I think its a pretty nifty idea but then again Im biased as I love watching speedruns :P
367,Whats up guys I just recently started streaming and hit 25 followers today That being said i came across a scenario that was pretty new to me and i decided Id come on here and share it So Im in the military and the little free time i have i usually spend it playing squads with my buddies whenever we have an opportunity to and we usually end up with a 3man Frequently on chat people spam and ask if they can play I finally gave in and let a random join and he proceeded to talk about how happy he was and that people usually ignore him We played a few games with him and he told us about how he was bullied and we really gave him a place to go and hangout and that felt pretty good The kid was 1213 ish and just looking for someone to play video games with Completely opened up my eyes to some of the scenarios that some of these people asking to play may be in and Ive tried more now to invite them I set something up on weekends kind of how stonemountain does to play with followers We as streamers really do have a tremendous opportunity to give people an escape from some of their harsh realities and even though Im playing games that i have fun with its even better now knowing that Im helping them have fun too I know i dont have a big channel but our ability to impact people at low levels of exposure is an awesome opportunity and i cant wait to see what i can do in the future Thanks for reading   Sorry in advance for poor spelling 
368,Edit: As someone below pointed out Twitch compresses all video uploads and doesnt allow source quality so I have reuploaded all the videos to dropbox for now and the videos should stream directly in your browser at the source quality Because its on dropbox there is a daily transfer limit so if it breaks just wait and try again the next day I will try to figure out a better solution for this but most places seem to transcode videos automatically  Slight clickbait title aside dont let this be the only thing you look at but rather look at it as a guide to lead you to where you are going I did not include many bitrate increments as I found most people will stream either around 30004000kbps or at 6000kbps so for the sake of my time I went with 3500 and 6000 as they are so common It is by no means comprehensive but rather serves as a general real world look into how your encoding settings affect your stream quality    I also did NOT extensively check every video so if there is one that is messed up please let me know so I can rerecord it and reupload it I spot checked them but I wasnt going to watch every single one through   What Ive done here is used OBS Studio to record the same scene using common settings at 2 different bitrates I have 720p and 1080p at 30fps and 60fps all at 6000kbps and 3500kbps bitrates using encoding presets from Ultrafast down to Medium and also using NVENC I figured this would be helpful in figuring out what you would expect from different combinations of settings including high motion and high foliage scenes I did leave out 900p but you can imagine it will look somewhere between the 720p and 1080p versions     The scenes range from slow movement to fast movement over foliage and also includes rain effects which is where encoders generally struggle and basically the worst case scenario for streaming     Ive linked all the individual videos through the 2 tables at the bottom for quick looks at specific combinations    3500kbps

369,I will be watching a stream on my PS4 at a perfectly reasonable volume and then an ad that is 3x louder comes blaring and I have to rush to mute my TV while the ad is playing  The ESL counterstrike ad that is playing right now is the worst offender but the EVE online ads also play much louder than the stream Im watching
370,Is it just me or have more and more inappropriate warnings and bans been happening over the last few months? I am really reconsidering using Twitch to stream based on their behavior as of late Tfues ban is 100 wrong no two ways about it Dr Disrespects warning for scratching his crotch totally uncalled for Twitch is becoming less and less of a place where you safely stream Its not Twitch itself its the community More and more trolls pop up daily to mess with other streamers Sure you can ban them in your channel but this doesnt prevent them from going to another channel and doing the same thing Its truly getting bad More and more small streamers are having to deal with these issues as well      I think we need to take a stand I think we need to make Twitch enforce some changes to protect the streamer     \1 Chat bans should be channel wide not just ban someone from your chat When you ban someone they shouldnt even be able to SEE your channel anymore on Twitch If they make a new account and come back to mess with you Hardware ban them from the entire site      \2 Accountability needs to be on the user causing the violation not the streamer This directly relates to TFues current ban He did nothing wrong he even banned the guys from his chat when they were talking shit But because they were able to stay and watch when he hosted  raided someone else those people transferred This is also realted to 1 of course      \3 Better administration of the site in general Twitch does no moderation at all unless something is reported I think the twitch staff needs to take a more active role in monitoring the smaller streamers and removing the people that are causing problems As a small streamer you may not have a moderator available at all times and the amount of people causing problems in chat is on the rise A small streamer cant be expected to be able to try and game entertain chat and moderate their channel with the amount of toxicity that is running rampant in the Twitch community currently For a new  small streamer its a lot to try and deal with and has made people quit streaming There are discussions about it all the time and something needs to be done      The major problem we are all having to deal with right now is the rising amount of toxicity on Twitch in general Its become really bad I have noticed it myself When I started streaming people were way cooler and way nicer and you didnt have to worry so much about every user coming into your channel How are you expected to grow as a new streamer when every 5 minutes you have to ban someone from your chat for saying something that could potentially get YOU banned I am seriously to a point where I think moving to another steaming platform is the safer alternative  I hate that every day I have to worry about getting banned for someone elses actions      Thoughts?
371,Streaming games like OSU League and Paragon were his favorite things to do We would always go into his dorm to watch his streams and he loved the twitch community in every way We want to celebrate his life by doing a 24 hour twitch stream of his favorite games but none of us really have any experience in game streaming Is there an effective way to promote this stream so we can help his family offset the costs of the funeral and help cope with his loss? Would anyone be willing to assist?  EDIT: Its worth mentioning that we arent doing this solely to raise funds for his family Any donations we receive during the stream would obviously be appreciated and would be donated to his family but we are really doing this because this is something he loved to do Stream interact with the community and just have fun with it We want to share his passion for streaming one more time
372,Why???? I like to search out newer less popular streamers to enjoyand lately I am seeing an increase in streamers with 10  20 followers using follower only mode for chat _  1  Any new person who comes to your stream is most likely just going to be turned off by this and leave Its as if you are holding new people hostage just so they follow and can chat  2 Its all about community growth at this point in your career and putting chatting The most important thing for a smaller streamer behind a wall is CRAZY  It boggles my mind when I see this IMO follower only mode is a tool to be used by people with solid viewership who just want to either do something special for their loyal fans or slow down the chat to make it readable  But someone with under 100 followers putting new people behind a follower only mode chat seems completely un reasonable dont you think?  EDIT::::  This option may be on by default for new streamers _  EDIT: Here are clear instructions on how to turn it off :D  Followers mode is like sub mode and is set via chat commands followers [duration]  Enables followersonly mode only users who have followed for duration may chat Examples: 30m 1 week 5 days 12 hours Must be less than 3 months to turn on followersoff to turn it off
373,I had a random guygal join my channel tonight claiming to be from bungie dropping hundreds of bits for playing a blizzard promoted game and gifting subs to my viewers The account had no history but they did have the gift icon next to their name Im super grateful but confused so I thought Id ask here
374,200: I really fin hate your streaming tbh  I feel like a real twitch streamer now   :
375,Twitch just kinda changed UI when i refreshed Now the channel info follow and subscribe buttons are on the Left side Info bar Also this bar is now not collapsible This happen for anyone else?  If this is a new thing gonna be that guy but it sucks
376,Or somethings wrong with my documents?
377,Just reminding those that might not have discretionary income or may not know your continued Subtember subscriptions WILL in fact charge you next month if you dont go into your settings and autocancel You can only cancel after they charge you the 1 Just giving a heads up since I would hate to see something that Twitch meant for good to turn into something that leaves a bad taste in your mouth
378,Every small streamer has seen these bots flood their chat lists every single stream Id love to ban them from showing up  is this possible? They have in many instances made known that they are collecting data  Just off the top of my head I can name about 68 bots that show up every stream  Bananennanen  Commanderroot  Cogwhistle  Decafsmurf  Electricalskateboard  Electricallongboard  Lanfusion  Slocool  v_and_k  virgoproz   EDIT  I would love to see twitch allow us the option to permanently remove these from our channels

382,Ive just been shown a 15 minute long advertisement for what essentially is a religious cult No joke The ad is in Danish and is probably only being shown to Danish viewers Im not sure the Twitch advertisement team have any idea who they have sold ad time to here and Id like to inform them
383,I enjoy watching small streams Heck I only start from the bottom of the list and work up when looking for a new stream to watch But not all small streams are great In fact many new streams I find seem to have a few pitfalls in common that I feel are bad habits or are hurting their streamchannel Now not all streamers care about building a community but for those that are these arent good ways to:   Not having a schedule Even if you have no idea what your schedule is let us know Or give us a general idea ex weeknights until whenever Because if I like your stream Ill first check your schedule to see if I should follow because I wont follow unless I know when to expect watching you   Your only panel is a donation button Pretty selfexplanatory We know what your priority is Especially when its a giant donation button    You ask for a follow host andor donation within minutes I just got here Let me watch before I decide to show support I understand youre trying to grow but thats like a musician on the street asking for a tip after playing one note    Awful videoaudio quality Now a lot of new streamers have bad streams earlyon but after that you should have worked out any technical issues Some streamers have horrible mic quality using their webcam to talk causing echoes and distortion unbalanced audio levels music is 4x louder than the streamers voice some have unsynced videoaudio which grinds my gears and many have laggy streams I usually notify the streamer and let it slide but if the streamer doesnt address it several streams later I know they dont want to put in the effort     Having a bland boring title I dont even click on these streams and move onto the next Examples? Heres a few: Playing CS:GO with friends OW stream PUBG gameplay thrilling   Streamers who dont care about their chat This may not apply to everyone but I watch Twitch to interact with people If I wanted to watch gameplay Id go to YouTube So I do like to type in chat to get a conversation going I know I am not entitled to get a response but when a streamer just focuses on gameplay I end up leaving immediately I know youre new and used to having 0 chat activity but do glance over once in a while    Having every overlay known to man on screen I mean we get youre trying to lookum legitimate? But you dont need so much stuff taking up space when you just started a week ago: Top Alltime Donator Top Monthly Donator Recent Donator etc cmon really? And this is your 2nd stream?   Not playing the right game Yeah this I also skip  along with bland titles If youre playing WoW but is listed under Battlefield 1 theres a 99 chance I wont stop by I know sometimes we forget to update titles but its very important to make a habit to check before a stream and when you change games midstream    Follower only chat We know followers mean the world to you but this is not a good way to start off Dont think oh if they want to chat theyll have to follow Easy follows As a new streamer you should welcome everyone into your chat excluding trolls of course    Having a poor attitude Complaining about growth emphasizing how badly you want to make a living from this looking sad when peeking at the viewer count etc Just bums viewers out and makes the stream hard to watch
384,I dont know if anybody has ever passed that I think its a milestone for Twitch streamers
385,Hi Im Sadomi I streamed back in the day in 20102011 when Streaming wasnt even a thing really Wish I stuck with it but life didnt allow me the chance Next thing I knew 6 Years later I dropped out of college Worked full time had a mental breakdown at work Seriously considered suicide Quit on the spot Then decided to Stream all day again I started with zero and so far with about 2 weeks of Streaming Ive gotten a lot of new friends and my stream is my new full time focus One of my Mods actually bought me a Pizza today I dont have a job so Im tight as hell on money so this was an amazing gesture  This post is mostly for me to be honest   nbsp;     1 Streaming is 25 playing video games 50 engagement 25 Technical difficulties 100 Effort nbsp;  2 I understand what love is now Its not being excited about it all the time Its being comfortable around someone or something I dont get the same excitement when I play Rocket League But I still enjoy it I can still play it everyday no problem But im no longer infatuated with it But if i didnt play Rocket League for a week Id probably freak out   3 People on the internet are jerks   4 People on the internet are some of the nicest most amazing people in the world   5 People are more real and direct with you then in the real world This can be good   6 Physical activity is SO IMPORTANT for everyday living   7 Rome wasnt built in a day    8 You need help if you have big aspirations Dont be afraid to ask for help   9 Networking is important But dont ever network Make friends and be active dont be shy behind your name   10 Video games can be so much fun   11 Video games can suck your soul away from you   12 Twitch and Youtube are both so Saturated at the lower levels   13 This is a Snowball Effect game Just from my personnel research   14 Gaming community is extremely eccentric vulgar and uncaring Be yourself and do what you like and youll have fun  15 Take a break No really take a break Go sit outside and eat a whole rotisserie  chicken masturbate shower do something by yourself with no stimulation it helps  16 If youre viewers support you support them Be there when you say you are No one and I mean NO ONE has to even VISIT your channel AT ALL They want to be there for some reason They are very forgiving At least mine are and MOST realize you are human  nbsp;  Streaming has been good for getting my head back into a right state of mind Ill keep streaming no matter what its more work than anything Ive ever done before in my life but Ive never felt so satisfied   I love you Twitch Community I really do     
386,Hi All   Just a quick thread about the changes to the policy on Music   https:wwwtwitchtvplegalcommunityguidelinesmusic  It seems now theres a lot more things that are deemed copyright infringement including from what I can tell:  Guitar Hero Just Dance Any covers using original backing tracks Karaoke not including Twitch Sings gameplay  Twitch Sings seemingly has rights for its covers so that works but other games may not give you the same rights   So this could lead to more vods being mutedpotentially DMCAd It also may seem in my cynical mind a ploy to push Twitch Sings as the only viable music based game that can be streamed

388,Hey everyone Ive put together a fairly sizable guide for new and growing broadcasters on Twitch and I was hoping to share it with all of you [You can download a PDF of the full guide here]https:wwwdropboxcoms4xbpa5v8zp88lfcStreaming20and20Finding20Success20on20Twitchpdf?dl=0  Be warned the guide is lengthy and definitely not meant to be read straight through from beginning to end Theres a lot of covered topics and theyre intended to be tackled as you need them Also many of them are geared towards broadcasters first starting out with Twitch Im hoping to post the entire thing here on the subreddit in manageable pieces over the next few weeks Feel free to share the guide in its complete form and I would appreciate any suggestions you might offer in the comments for revisions in an updated release The first few sections follow below  nbsp;  nbsp;  Part I: The Basics of Streaming  Starting Out New broadcasters have a challenging time ahead of them on Twitch  Theres so much to do nearly endless things to learn and nobody really knows you exist Even if youre willing to work hard knowing how to get started is a challenge in itself  What follows is a fairly comprehensive list of things you probably want to work on as you first start broadcasting  Initially youll benefit from doing a lot of learning and practicing Unless you have experience entertaining public speaking and working with the relevant equipment and software there is a lot to pick up before you can expect your content to be good  Successful streamers make something worth watching After all if your stream isnt entertaining why should anyone want to see it?  To start off Ive broken this section down into five main topics:   What Are Your Goals?  Planning and Mental Preparation  Equipment and Software   Tips for Early Growth  Positive Streaming Behaviors  I recommend reading through these sections and putting some thought and work into planning your broadcast  Make a basic plan for your channel and then just start streaming  experiment and find out if you even like it  Read the list of positive streaming behaviors and incorporate them into your cast  Finally as you find the need for more specific information approach individual sections in Part II of this guide for additional advice  nbsp; nbsp;   What Are Your Goals? If youre even thinking about broadcasting on Twitch stop and answer that question Twitch is an amazing environment with room for broadcasters of every size with every imaginable way of using their service  What do you want your place to be?  Knowing your goals impacts how you should be reading this guide   How large do you want your broadcast to be? You may be streaming for personal friends a small audience or tens of thousands of viewers Smaller audiences will be easier to reach Larger audiences will take effort and compromises to attain   What is your gaming niche? Maybe you love speedrunning  You might play an MMORPG or a MOBA You might be into indie games console games classic games fighting games a single game or every new release  Or you might be a variety caster playing any game at any time   What will the attitude of my cast be? You could be serious angry or lighthearted Do you want people laughing with you at you or because of you? Will you cultivate an air of maturity surrounding your stream or is anything permitted?   What can you do that makes you special? At the end of 2015 Twitch had over 21 million unique broadcasters and 13k partnered channels Obviously not everyone is going to be unique in a group that size but what can you do to make yourself stand out in peoples minds?  You dont need all the answers when youre just starting out but the more you know the better off youll be If you want to have at least a small regular audience streaming on Twitch is at least an involved hobby  Reaching even more people makes it more like managing a small business Answering the above questions is like the first step of putting together a business plan  Once you know what youre trying to accomplish you can start building a plan for your cast to reach those goals  nbsp; nbsp;   Planning and Mental Preparation Let me begin with a reminder: know your goals for streaming When you think about the next few steps realize that different goals require different things A strict streaming schedule for example may leave someone testing the waters with broadcasting burnt out but is necessary for someone trying hard to maximize their stream growth With that in mind here are some preliminaries you should think about and work on as you start toying with broadcasting   Remember to Enjoy Yourself     If you dont enjoy creating content people likely wont enjoy the content you create Personality and energy are important for drawing people to your stream Once you start losing those because you arent enjoying yourself something needs to change Before you even start broadcasting you dont know if youll enjoy it  Keep fun in mind as you think about these suggestions and never forget it as your channel grows   Figure Out What Makes You Interesting     Take a long few minutes to figure out what are the best aspects about you You dont need something crazy different or unique here Are you an exceptionally skilled gamer? Do you think youre funny? Can you instruct others well? Make people feel good about themselves? If you cant think of anything you arent trying hard enough       At this point trying to fully brand your channel may be difficult and you may not have the casting experience to make it work for you But you can still be interesting and play to your strengths Figuring out what they are is a good start   Name Your Channel Carefully     Your Twitch handle will stick with you the entire time you broadcast Name changes are next to impossible to get and you probably dont want to rebuild everything on a new channel just because you want a different name Ideally your name should be unique and interesting Symbols underscores and random lettersnumbers are probably unnecessary When in doubt simple is probably best      Once you create [your Twitch name]https:passporttwitchtvusersnew take thirty minutes out of your day [Create an email account]https:accountsgooglecomSignUp tied to that name Use it to register accounts with your Twitch handle on [Twitter]https:twittercomsignup [Facebook]https:wwwfacebookcompagescreate?ref_type=registration_form [Youtube]https:supportgooglecomyoutubeanswer161805?hl=en [Discord]https:supportdiscordappcomhcenusarticles204849977HowdoIcreateaserver [Steam]https:storesteampoweredcomjoin and any other forms of social media or services you may ever think about using It costs nothing and youll reserve those spaces for whenever theyre relevant to you   Think About Your Schedule     When you stream is important especially to you Committing to more than you can enjoyably do is a disaster waiting to happen However streaming more hours is generally better for growing a broadcast and keeping those hours relatively consistent from week to week benefits both you and your viewers Finding a happy medium between randomly casting and a strict schedule is fairly important      Some things to keep in mind:      Short streams make it hard to reach new viewers and hold interest Broadcasting at minimum 24 hours at a time usually works well      Many professional broadcasters stream 48 hours at a time 57 days a week You dont need to do this However if your schedule allows it and you enjoy streaming it is probably good for growth      Twitch is worldwide and covers many time zones If your stream times shift wildly from day to day youll be reaching viewers in many different time zones making it harder to get regular viewers       Start small and leave room to grow Find a few regular times to broadcast throughout the week where you could have extra time to stream if you feel like it Try to commit to some relatively short broadcasts and keep going if you enjoy it      Remember that changing your broadcast times without warning will make it more difficult for viewers to catch your stream again   Practice Talking to Yourself About Everything You Do     Streaming especially without a large audience benefits from constant commentary  You need to be engaging and interesting to other people who may not even be there  Learn to narrate your life Explain everything youre doing remembering that it may not always be clear to other people Commentate your thought process  make your internal monologue external with some filtering of course Learning how to do that before you start broadcasting is a great place to start   Watch Other Streams Critically     You probably already watch at least a few very decent streamers on Twitch for personal enjoyment There should be some things that they do wonderfully on stream and at least a few things that could stand some improvement Watch their streams and figure out what those things are Emulate good qualities and try to avoid the bad Do this with as many different broadcasters as you can Take notes And when you eventually start broadcasting watch your past streams and do the same   Dont Commit To Being Yourself     Who you are and how you feel in your everyday life doesnt have to determine how you act on stream You can be yourself or an even better you  After all you probably dont naturally talk to yourself as you play video games  So why draw the line there?  Be open to experimentation especially before you have a solid audience  Try being silly excited bouncy crazy anything  Exaggerate your best qualities  Minimize your worst  Focus on how you say words and improve the way you speak Be willing to be more outgoing and interesting      There are no personality police  Nobody will say you cant act that way because you werent that way before  Think of this like The New Guy  Twitch is a place where you are free to redefine yourself   Consider the niche you want to occupy     Theres no need to decide what your place will be on Twitch too early on but realize that the types of games you play and when you switch them will impact your viewing audience  Know that the way you behave and how you interact with your audience shapes the way your stream will grow and how your chat will develop  Start determining these things as you experiment with broadcasting and learn more about them as you begin attracting regular viewers  nbsp;  nbsp;  This is just the beginning more sections to follow later Again you can download the full guide [here]https:wwwdropboxcoms4xbpa5v8zp88lfcStreaming20and20Finding20Success20on20Twitchpdf?dl=0 And I appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have to offer  Post 1: Starting Out What Are Your Goals?

389,In case you missed it Twitch updated their [Broadcaster Requirements]https:helptwitchtvcustomerportalarticles1253460broadcastrequirements page today on the help portal The new guidelines specify a recommended 36 megabits for your bitrate range rather than the old recommended value of 3500 With better transcoding options rolling out more people will have quality options so if you havent already consider bumping your bitrate up and enjoying better video quality on Twitch 
390,This is meant as a discussion about what happened after a wellknown streamer faked a SWAT invasion on his stream as the finale Twitch rewarded him for this behavior with a joke of a ban 24 hours giving him an insane amount of free publicity and giving him an even bigger stream when he came back today Hes been making fun of the ban the entire time tweeting about being in jail and putting bars over his webcam   Swatting is extremely dangerous and illegal behavior Making light of legitimate swatting teaches kids that theyll be rewarded with the attention that they desire It says that swatting is funny and okay and that a real SWAT strike might be even funnier People can die from swatting Family members have had guns pointed at them and even had heart attacks from the stress and fear induced   I dont have a problem with the streamer in question most of the time I think that he works hard to produce good content for his fans However faking a SWAT attack was not okay and should be dealt with by Twitch not rewarded   So what do you guys think? Should I fake a SWAT attack to bring more attention to my stream? Or should I do it to someone else since its so funny?
391,But I want to wish you all the quiet holidays Christmas whatever you fancy and prosperous Happy and Healthy new year  Thank you for all the help you provided
392,made a thread on this but I guess i didnt explain it correctly I am getting my vods muted in super Mario maker because of these two songs https:youtuber0NR1JKskc?t=3m47s https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=8eloXBu6DXQ when this used to happen I would just tag the claim as a false id and it would get overturned now with twitches new layout I can no longer find the page to submit a claim can anyone help me as it was NOT Nintendo that filed the claim
393,So [this whisper icon]http:iimgurcombqk9hXIpng is new or newly positioned i never used it before or ever will in the future to twitch and immensely frustrating  It literally blocks the theatre mode button in theatre mode full screen and also blocks the full screen mode button as well so i cant toggle between fullscreen and theatre mode which is what i like to do when browsing on my second monitor 
394,No names will be given  I just reported someone for selfharmbecause there was no other catagory for this because they have their phone mounted on the dash and they are constantly reading chat while driving on the highway at night  taking your eyes off the road for even one second is all it takes to end yours or someone elses life  You SHOULD NOT be allowed to read your streams chat while youre driving  Please tell me Im not alone on this???  Can the Twitch Devs add this into the TOS or something? That streamers will not read chat if they are driving Or SOMETHING  I mean the guy is reading full sentences from his chat while hes driving
395,Doesnt matter how big or how small the streamer is someone in chat is always asking to 1v1 them Its usually not actual viewers or people that are a part of the community but randoms that come in and ask 
396,Someone mentioned that if anyone admits to being a young kid that they ban them to be safe  Ive never heard of this before but I do genuinely hate having to deal with children in chat and Im not sure on Twitchs stance I dont think the mature stream warning says anything about age restrictions though?
397,I dont know if Im the only one that does thisbut if I wanna watch a game Ill actually look for a streamer who doesnt have a lot of views Mainly because I know how great it is to get a viewer on my stream  AnywaysIve found that the majority of these small streamers dont say ANYTHING And I dont just mean to me in the chatI mean they dont say anything at all like they dont even own a microphone I even started to time itId give each streamer 5 minutes and if there was nothing said Ill leave  Just a reminder to say something even if you dont think anyone is watching Because itll drive away potential new viewers trust me its frustrating I wanna support these small streamers 
398,Would appreciate some feedback on it : Was up until 6am this morning writing was a lot of fun  Includes recommended hardware software microphonewebcam figuring out your bit rate setting up obs explanation of scenessources and then some  http:wwwaxledoesgamingcom201612howtostartstreamingontwitchhtml

400,The Xbox One app is horrendous Its alright streaming live somewhat I guess but beyond that it kind of sucks Heres a couple reasons why:  1 Crashes often Very often 2 If a past broadcast contained even a little bit of copywritten material you cant watch ANY of that broadcast 3 Navigating videos suck Lets say theres a 5 hour video and you wanted to watch something specific 2 hours in  youd be there for a long time fast forwarding your way to it 4 [https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments92nydblatest\_xbox\_one\_app\_update\_breaks\_back\_button]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments92nydblatest_xbox_one_app_update_breaks_back_button  Kodi on the Xbox resolves all these issues Doesnt crash You can watch videos regardless of copywritten material albeit with the volume muted during the copywritten parts You can navigate long videos easily and quickly Back button actually works  Please resolve these issues its not a good look  Edit: Im confused why anyone would downvote this these are honest issues the Twitch app on Xbox has Im not trying to be rude

404,I love Twitch  I watch on my phone my computer through apple tv on my xbox etc  In our living room we use an xbox one x and previously an xbox one as the general streaming content provider and interface for the TV    nbsp;  The Twitch Xbox one app has always been mediocre although it didnt used to be anywhere near  this buggy  Currently Im happy if I can watch for more than 30 minutes without it crashing or telling me a stream is offline when it isnt or just glitching audiovideo in and out randomly  Recently it has started green screening at random as well  Just now watching a dota match Ive had to refresh close app quit app reset app reload repeat 3 times in ~50 minutes and this is a fairly common experience  I dont believe this is an xbox one x specific bug because I had a similar experience on my xbox one for years   nbsp;  Please help  We love you and just want to use your product more :  Also if we could get vods available on xbox one x app at the same time theyre available on PC and mobile that would be incredible  Very frustrating to not be able to watch a decent chunk of content on that platform  Edit  Wow this thread blew up Glad Im not the only one  Hopefully a member of the twitch team saw this and may consider getting a few people to work on a revamped app?  I believe amazon literally partnered with Microsoft for 4K streaming content on the one x launch makes perfect sense that one of their subsidiaries should have the best streaming platform possible on the system as well 
405,My PC is on my desk next to my monitor Its an mITX build but still powerful so when I play a demanding game obviously the fans turn on And OBS always picks up that background noise Well that was annoying for me I used noise gate but that just removes the noise when you dont talk As soon as I started talking the background noise was there  And then I realized there is a filter called noise suppression Well that removed the whole background noise and actually I can keep my mic always on The difference is day and night  Im just sharing this story because I was thinking about picking up a new headset or mic just because of this Obviously having a good quality mic is nice but if you are on a tight budget like me this little filter can save you a lot of money I dont have to buy a new mic now turns out my current one is still pretty good
406,I had a stream today in which there were some of my friends watching but it said that i had 1 viewer I knew that they were watching since we are friend on twitch itself and it said that they were watching the stream Some of them were on mobile others on pc Worst thing was when I looked at my stream recap in the dashboard it said my maximum viewer count was 0 and that i had 0 views Is it just Twitch? Or may I be doing something wrong myself?  Edit: If you can retweet this We could get a response from Twitch Support https:twittercomKurnFlexxstatus1051586312766181376

408,Advice: Dont stream PUBG       Its a popular PC game thats super easy to stream so it has billions of streamers   If you stream PUBG your channel will be burried underneath hundreds of thousands of other channels with zero or one viewer   Its a terrible stream game for people who dont already have an established audience  Even if youre getting those fake app followers youre not getting real viewers      Multiple times a week I see people post here because they cant find viewers  Theyll talk about the games they play or theyll link their profile and 90 of the time its a PUBG stream      I get it  You like the game and want to stream something you like  But you need to understand that there are consequences to streaming this game      Not trying to sound like a dick but its not a good stream game  Youre not only picking the category with the most competition but the category with the strongest competition as well since some of the biggest streamers out there play PUBG      Its just a bad market       There are other games this applies to as well but PUBG is a big one that I see most often here     
409,seeing the chats reaction i think would make the clip more enjoyable  EDIT: Look Ma front page  Twitch Staff response thanks guys :D and huge shoutout to Twitch for implementing this so fast
410,I swear 1 year from now the hottest topic on here will be best Twitch alternative? The page is absolutely loosing its focus and suffers from the same exact symptoms as Windows does Twitch thinks all these new features make it so easy  and fast and all those little buttons everywhere make it look like the fucking Enterprise but seriously it starts looking like what a fucking Nissan Skyline driving 19 years old basecap superhero would program   Twitch blog  fucking hell why cant we just have a streaming service without making friends and joining networks and bla bla bla     edit: No offense to 19 year olds or anything Twitch just has taken the page far far away from what it used to be The focus went from establishing poleposition in livestreaming so clearly to binding people to the site and creating an illusion of networking Combine that with all those flashy little features like this stupid thing when a video doesnt close but instead is thumbnailed to the bottom of the window and FUCKING SUGGESTED FRIENDS and you get something that i clearly didnt expect from a company such as Twitch
411,Be yourself play the games you really enjoy Dont worry about what anybody is thinking of you or if you should talk more or if youre annoying Just BE and do what you enjoy and if somebody happens to click on your stream thats a person to have a conversation with Youre not acting youre enjoying Youll get nice people and youll have a douche nozzles every now and then but theyre two clicks away from being timed out or banned and shut out Dont let it bother you if no ones watching Youre playing the game because you want to and why not stream it and have the opportunity to meet some people?   Ive struggled with anxiety and depression Millions have Its an every day struggle saying the right thing and doing the things that make you look as smart as you know you are People can be terrible ignorant and self absorbed thinking theyre better than the next guy But in all reality nobodys better than anyone Anybody could learn the things you know just as well and if not better Then you can learn those things more in depth and better than them Were all the same Say somebody says something that you dont agree with You dont have to say anything you dont have to talk to them anymore Theres nothing wrong with anything you do unless you physically hurt someone Or mentally fuck with a person   
412,Brand new streamer started 1016 and Im struggling to carry a conversation with nobody I some times have viewers and occasionally have chatters So keeping a flowing conversation isnt exactly easy Any tips?  Edit: Thanks for all the replies this post got way bigger than I expected
413,Hi there  This thought occurred to me after I was practicing some Pokemon Trading Card Game on stream for an upcoming Tournament and the user I was going to play against started asking me what I was going to play or if I had VoDs etc   While I dont mind showing another player my VoDs or strats Id rather wait to do so after Ive played them in a competitive setting and the match is over instead of giving them Replay videos clips etc before the match that could be used against me   Would it be difficult to allow streamers to temporarily hide their VoDs instead of the basic 3 options of:   Dont archive alltogether   Archive them and be vulnerable in these situations   Hide behind a Subscription Paywall Which people can access still by subbing if they really wanted to   I would just like a simple feature to turn off VoDs from public viewing and turn them back on again when comfortable  Thanks
414,I wrote a guide on how to embed your Twitch stream on Twitter Its a little long and complicated but hopefully you guys like it Theres a link in the article for a google form to fill out if you want my help doing it for you   <3 Pods  https:twitchhelpwordpresscom20170417embedyourlivestreamontwitter  Edit: whoa this blew up way more than I thought it would Ive worked through half of the form responses so far so if you havent received a response please know that it is still coming soon
415,As a small streamer I hate that I will look at my viewer list sometimes and see like 4 bot accounts sitting in there Id love to be able to kick these accounts out of my channel Would also be great for making people not able to watch your stream as trolls can still possibly screw with you if you happen to be playing a multiplayer game of any kind
416,Checked with multiple browsers Nothing is loading  EDIT: Incase there are any other survivors Its working for me again Kappa
417,Twitch now shows a Sub Gifter Badge on people who gift subs I dont know the details about how it works or whats required to get this badge how many gifts but if anyone has details on this Id love some https:imgurcomaCRZAH  EDIT: More details are in a blog post update linked below but heres a summary: So youll get the badge if you have an active gifted sub on that channel When all of your gifted subs expire so does your badge The gift shared text in chat now also displays how many gift subs youve given for that streamer as well
418,Hey there Remember me? I used to post guides like these all the time back then Im back  New streamers dont have it easy Theres just too many things to keep in mind: graphics microphones cameras etc But dont worry we got you covered Here is the ultimate cheatsheet so you dont forget some of the most important tangents  If you ever watched a successful stream youll notice they contain all of the items mentioned below This stuff will easily put your stream miles ahead and let you focus on the real thing: entertaining people and playing games  1 Graphic Branding  Branding is basically the process of creating a brand In this case were talking about your personal brand   Not a fancy word if you dont like marketing but this is a fact: branding settles an identity I command you to open any successful stream and check their graphics Do they share a same theme? Yes they do  Your brand will develop over time so dont worry if youre layout is not awsome yet Just make sure your graphics share some theme or style so they create your enviroment  What youre going to do:   Choose your weapons ie Photoshop or GIMP or find a designer   Create your graphics making sure they share a theme colors style etc Easy     2 Create a Schedule  Consistence is the best word to sum it up Its easier to grow an audience if they can find you at the same time next week  One of my favorite streamers [Sirhcez]https:wwwtwitchtvsirhcez caught my atention because he always streamed around the time I went to bed I would let his stream run on the background and eventually fall asleep He is not boring at all just pretty chill and that was awsome for bedtime  Hear me out on this one:  Setting up a Schedule is paramount if youre planning to do this fulltime If I watch your stream today and its entertaining as hell then I hope to find you again tomorrow Or at least next week at the same time Ya follow?  It doesnt really matter how frequently you plan on streaming this is entirely up to you But here are the best practices:   Stream roughly at the same time each week   Make your live broadcast sessions at least 4 hours long  You may say but hey Bastian why 4 hours thats too long It may be but what will happen once someone goes to Facebook finds you posted your link with a big WATCH PLEASE and arrives when youre offline?  They will never come back  That sounds harsh but it has been proven: if they expect something and get dissapointed youre done  3 Plan your activities  Rather than asking your new viewers and wasting a lot of valuable time try to have things mostly planned out  Yes its ok to ask your viewers what they want but try to avoid delays and dead times No one will enjoy watching you download a 10GB game that someone suggested No one  So what can you do to avoid this? Have most things planned out  If you have 10 games on your Steam list then pick some options and go for that Today youre gonna stream Game 1 and Game 2 not all of them Avoid switching many times once again delays and dead times are a nono  4 Social Media  Have your social assets up and running so people can follow you from the get go I know they can click follow or subscribe silly But for the most part they will notice youre streaming once you tweet it or state so on your social media of choice  Consider Facebook and Twitter a Must If your platform is not Youtube Gaming then you may also want to go for a Youtube Channel for highlights and what not Fill your bio description or whatever fields needed and add graphics that also relate to your channel Done  You dont need to be active on every platform so dont go crazy making profiles on each existing SM site   Some viable options depending on your audience:   Tumblr  Pinterest  Instagram  A side story There was a channel back then that had at least 50 images or panels because the guy was linking to each possible social media from VK to Pinterest Why?     These is pretty much everything you should cover before you start going ham Remember: these are important but dont spend weeks determining which colors to use and games to play This is about entertainment and the most important part is your live action   Original source: [The Ultimate Cheatsheet for New Streamers]http:dotliftcomblogmustchecklistnewstreamers
419,Today marks a a full week of streaming I have learned a few things that I am going to toss out to other new streamers and also see if you guys have any awesome suggestions that I may have overlooked    1 Check your OBS Log  First how to do this: Settings >Open Configuration Folder > logs > Date   What I learned from this was things like this:   19:23:12: Audio timestamp for device Microphone USB Audio Device was behind target timestamp by 80  My mic was cutting out people had mentioned it but I was at a loss as too why Checked my logs saw this and realized I needed to increase my scene buffering time Who knows how long I would have let this go on Going to check my logs more often now to ensure everything is running smoothly    2 Always prepare to be hosted   Ive been hosted once on my very first day I had one viewer and all of a sudden had 200 What happened? I fell apart complete and utterly I lost focus of the game started to play horribly and couldnt keep up with chat at all Since then I have prepared a Hotkey to switch my chat to slowmo This way I am not so busy trying to keep up with chat I fail at the game I am playing 3 or 4 times in a row    Edit 1: When I wrote this I thought that slowmo might be the answer for a newer streamer but some people have mentioned it will actually hurt more then help So I noting that here and totally starting to agree Like I said I am fairly new to streaming and I would love to hear how some of you guys handle this situation   3 Laugh at yourself   You are going to mess up I certainly did all the time I still do all the time I mean last night I was keeping up with 8 viewers in chat Playing the Game and trying to keep my thoughts straight after the 6 hour mark and the stream delay I totally called out another Streamer instead of myself I just had to laugh and keep going so poke fun at yourself if you cant laugh at yourself how are your viewers going to be able too?   4 Dont get disappointed and dont get greedy  When you get 7 New followers one day and then the next day you get 1 you can feel a bit discouraged The reality is that in my case I was being greedy I wanted 7 again I really love the community I have already grown and I wanted it to keep growing But hey instead of focusing on new viewers? I decided to focus on the group I already have who are taking time to watch me   5 Webcam Placement   One thing I learned was to put the screen that I am watching chat on on the same side as my Camera I didnt want a straight on view for my camera so I have it on a tripod to the left because of my Mic placement Well I had chat on a monitor to the right This might sound crazy but when I talk to my viewers I am staring at chat well I wasnt making eye contact in a way I feel the quality has improved since I moved the screen Now when I am talking to them I am looking more directly at them   6  Its better to start a few minutes late  Then to start on time and flail around trying to get everything set up and ready I did this 3 times and each time I had people come and go when I was trying to get set up Much better to have things in place and then go no one wants to watch me get everything ready they want to watch me joke and play the game   7 Networking  I fail at networking You know it is bad when your viewers are doing more on Twitter then you are to promote you This was certainly an eye opener when I found out that some of my viewers were doing more on Twitter then me Something I have taken from and will certainly remember    8 Look Up Talking Points  Sometimes the game is slow You have the urge to be quiet But you have to keep talking and you have nothing to talk about I started to look up some gaming news and randomly when I find myself in this spot start rambling off about this or that title that is coming out ect ect This has helped greatly because when I have someone join I am talking about something interesting and it certainly helps to keep people around    9 Check your spam folder  I had one follower send me a message and it got shot into this folder He shows up every night now and one of the reasons why he has said is because I took the time to write him back    10 Not everyone is going to like you   Be it trolls be it people be it your friends Some people are simply not going to like your stream Just have to live with it and drive on I dont like every musician so why should I expect everyone to like me? Keep focused on those who do like you and when someone trolls you just smile laugh and say things like Yeah I do suck man if they dont get to you they will leave    Hope at least one of these lessons learned helps someone else out You guys take it easy
420,For the past weeks there has been a threads and 1 in particular in rglobaloffensive that shows proof that certain streamer is viewbotting every single day  It has over 4500 upvotes and even reached 1 on rall and twitch isnt going to do anything about it? so viewbotting is allowed as long as you have a sub button? The thread includes  graphs and proof of how this certain streamer is using the viewbot to boost his viewercount to sometimes the mostviewed streamer on the CSGO sub  How is what this certain streamer is doing fair? Wasnt twitch against these type of things or does twitch only ban those RuneScape viewbots that try to phish you?  Im not naming anyone and if anyone but its on the csog subreddit  Its a shame nothing has been done about this person already  Edit: So according to everyone here there is someone that is stalking this dude so much and is willing to spend so much money that said person instantly buys him views from a viewbot RIGHT when he starts to stream? Gee I wonder who would do that  And he also just talked about this so I woulnt be suprised half the comments are his fanboys on here  he needs to stop viewbotting  Im thinking about starting my own channel now and buying myself 5k viewers everyday and just play it off as if someone else is doing it  Viewbotting is expensive the streamer that is doing this gets his money back however   more fame and views by people checking it out and wondering why hes got so many views
421,Whats stopping them from just taking the money for themselves?   Im talking about both small streamers probably way harder to verify but the big streamers as well specifically the ones who do St Jude charity streams annually 
422,These streams have been going on for years and it has gotten to the point where its embarrassing for other gamers to even click on the game because three of the ten top streams are always fake Im Quitting \or\ So and So streamer has died click this link to post your thoughts on the Runescape Forum  \  The way they work is there is a steam with a name similar to a popular streamer with a title saying something has happened to them Nervous fans who dont know any better then click on the stream and are prompted to a link in the description that appears to be the Runescape website They type in their information to post on the forums and the website owner logs into the account sells all their items and in some instances their account for thousands of real world dollars The fact that these suicide accounts have been around for so long is an indication of their success and impact on the community  \  Here are my recommendations for the streamers who should receive this privilege  b0aty  faux  sparcmac  sick\_nerd  monnirs  alfie  black  amenityrs  alkan  ricecup  mr\_mammal  Together these streamers are live most if not all of the day  \  Please take this into consideration for the betterment of the game and even contact the games creator Jagex through Game Developers such as JagexAsh on twitter  Thank You
423,I think a lot of what us newer streamers have an issue with is keeping a new viewer stick around for your stream I know some things such as too much clutter in your overlay bad quality micwebcam silence etc can turn a viewer away Personally what would keep you as a viewer stay  ?
424,Bit of a security awareness thing Do NOT visit twitchtoolscom It has a driveby downloader built into the sites javascript that WILL infect your computer None of the AntiVirus engines are detecting it atm either so stay FAR away from it
425,Soooo I recently started streaming and I havent really had that many viewers and no one really interacting in chat Today I started playing The Walking Dead and the viewer count went up to around 45 and someone said Hi in the chat and I answered and asked him how to pronounce his nick etc It felt nice He didnt say anything more though and left and the viewer count went back to 1 It felt a bit disheartening   About 3040 minutes after I started streaming a friend came into the channel and told me my microphone wasnt working That made me feel extremely stupid Such a simple but vital thing and I had forgotten to check it I fixed it and continued streaming and I eventually had some people hanging out and talking and got a couple of followers so that was really awesome But it still felt bad that I missed out in the start   I realize it doesnt matter at all in the end and that it happens but it still felt kind of bad So if you get into a channel and you see someone on cam talking and not hearing them or any other issue you think might not be correct please make them aware even if you leave immediately after I know its not your problem or obligation or anything and its a stupid mistake but its a nice thing to do and it could help out a lot      tldr: If you see something wrong with the stream please try to make the streamer aware Be nice      Edit for clarity: Of course this is my own fault and the streamers responsibility What I mean is that sometimes it might be difficult for the streamer to know if somethings not right something might happen mid stream etc This was purely my own stupid mistake but it made me think about it in general
426,Good morning I wanted to post this to twitchuservoicecom but I do not use Facebook or Google for personal reasons Ive seen a few Suggestion threads on this sub so Im hoping this might get some support  A couple days ago a controversial feminist charity held a fundraiser for themselves on Twitch The charity in question provided no information on their Twitch profile or Subscription pages about the nature of their organization or fundraiser Viewers were encouraged to support this fundraiser when the only visible way to do so was with a channel Subscription which would not meet documentation requirements for charitable donations The Subscription page for the channel made no promises about whether the money would go directly to the fundraising effort or even to the charitable organization itself There is no VOD of this fundraiser or transcript of the claims made during it but Ive gone into more detail about what I feel this charityfundraiser did wrong [here]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments4ds8l3so_how_does_people_feel_about_twitch_putting_thisd1v97zv  This is the most highprofile instance that I am aware of involving a charity fundraiser on Twitch where the raisingcollection of funds was done improperly and quite possibly illegally Although the situation was unusual in that it involved an actual charity which should know better about documentation requirements its methods of collection were unfortunately par the course for Twitch There are numerous examples in this community of popular partnered Broadcasters relying on the Subscription button as a charity drive tool Some of these fundraising efforts are organized by wellintentioned streamers who have no idea they are acting with reckless disregard for charitable solicitation laws Others knowingly wade into this shadow of controversy because Subscriptions are the most convenient tool at their disposal for tracking the monetary contributions of viewers Oftentimes however Broadcasters who engage in this practice are clouded with accusations of potential fraud in an environment absent of any accountability and auditing  TLDR: Charity streams and fundraisers in which viewers are induced to Subscribe to a channel or send a lumpsum payment directly to a Broadcasters PayPal unnecessarily expose streamers to liability and viewers to fraud This practice is for the most part largely unregulated on Twitch to my knowledge If Twitch is not going to moderate this practice then I implore them to create alternative legitimate tools for Broadcasters who wish to raise money for charity  My suggestion is to introduce a Charity button similar to the Subscribe button with all money going directly to a designated registered charity This could be a page hosted on Twitch similar to the Subscription page or a direct link to an official DonorDrive page for the registered charity Ideally it would be possible for this process to hook into the Twitch API in some way so that streaming tools could be written that track viewer contributions in the same way that they already do for Subscriptions  There are many reasons why such a tool would be of benefit to Twitch its community and charities I feel that it would also quash potential fraud and further legitimize Twitch as a platform for charitable causes in gaming Thoughts?

428,I use Twitch on an Android phone and it is so irritating when the stream title is longer than what the little box showing the stream can display and it doesnt show me the full title Would be nice if the text scrolled or something so you could see the full title and if the title actually displayed when youre watching the stream This is one of many little improvements that can be made to the Twitch mobile app
429,Whilst streaming The Division Beta yesterday I was hosted by a fellow streamer my view count rocketed to 350 and my chat went crazy For the next hour the view count slowly trickled down to around 100 Now here comes the crazy part I managed to hold down and entertain these 100 viewers for another 3 hours They stayed with me and my chat was highly active I received amazing feedback some of which was critical to my streaming technique which I will now work to improve I also gained nearly 80 followers in that space of time and Im extremely proud of myself The stream totalled 135 hours and there was never a quiet period  Sorry if nobody cares that much my motivation is through the roof and I just had to tell someone
430,Before you start streaming make sure you stand up and walk around for a bit to get your blood flowing Put your hands in the air and then make a super hero pose This technique is used by people before they go into interviews to get their energy up It may help you as well  Just wanted to throw this small bit of advice out there   Cheers  Edit: Didnt think this post would blow up so much Yo if you guys could hit up my SoundCloud that would be sick s
431,In light of all the discussions about privacy lately I put together [an article]http:wwwsuperphreniccomsafetyandsecurityforstreamershtml with some tips about improving your online safety  Heres a brief overview of the main article:   Maintain basic account security with strong passwords and twofactor authentication   Dont use your real name like anywhere  Use a new email address for your streaming brand  Upgrade your PayPal account to a business account  If you buy your own domain keep your info out of the WHOIS database if the privacy option is available in your country  Pick a different birthday my favorite tip  When youre sharing stories be aware of how the information could be crossreferenced to find you eg if you say you live next to a town with the worlds biggest spork you just really narrowed it down  Remove EXIF data and personal information from images  Dont use the same photo in multiple places TinEye will catch you  Be careful when integrating IRL friends into your stream Talk to them about the potential problems of oversharing and make sure theyre briefed on internet security for their own sakes  Consider a PO boxbut not one in your town can pinpoint streamers from small towns  Devote some time to removing your info from free online databases Spokeo Pipl White Pages etc  Start now Even if you already launched your stream you can still take steps upgrading your PayPal account changing your associated emails to improve your security  This isnt an allinclusive list of things you can do to protect your privacy as a streamer but its a good start If you arent already doing these things you really really should start
432,As the title says I just received my first Twitch Affiliate payout and man it feels good Although its only 107 which isnt a lot in GBP its really going to help me out with a few bills and supporting my streaming efforts  I still find it crazy that people are happy to donate to me directly only because I am playing a game and entertaining them Its still quite a foreign concept in my mind but a happy one nonetheless
433,A streamer on IRL consistently puts herself into the IRL category while playing video games for hours After I told her mods about it I was told in a private conversation by one of them that staff hangs out in her channel regularly and they dont mind: http:imgurcomaFHthe  Shes playing a game and the focus is on the game so she shouldnt be in the IRL section Reporting her doesnt make a difference because it is going on for months Why are streamers being treated so differently?
434,They should just stick to gaming content personally I really dont want this political bs on twitch 
435,The old one was fine show the games with viewers first Then have a separate tab for who Im following And a popular channels tab   I dont know whats up with this pulse crap its so weird Like are we facebook now? Because if I wanted social media Id go on twitter lol I hate the fact that on mobile you can swipe channels its already fucked me up a few times when I accidentally swipe  I like the look of it Usability not so much   edit: [little diagram of why the new UI sucks]http:iimgurcomq4thAuIjpg Note the amount of redundant UI elements on the front page Why is a featured quake stream take up half of it when I dont even watch quake? Why is there even a recently whipsered section? Why do I see a random clip from a random streamer? A lot of it is like useless to me
436,The banning policy and practices are really starting to make the platform look like a joke 
437,Now let me clear this up Im not hating on you for your success or anything like that Good job keep at it  But these posts set a bad precedent if posts like these become widely accepted every new streamer and their grandmother will be posting the same goddamn thing   This may just be me but I also view it as a poor way of advertising   Thoughts?
438,Before I start the reason Im making this is because I was gulible enough to waste my time and sadly a bit of money   There was a twitch post 2 days ago called  small streamers have to stick together or something  like that  The twitch user   has sense deleted  his reddit account   and removed most of that post  In it he talked about his friend  streaming for a long time  and how he spontaneously decided  to make his night  and send all of his followers  to him  This reddit post got very popular   And his viewers  went from 2 20 concurrent on twitch   I sadly was one of them   Yesterday I was watching and you can check his vod he bots 1600 followers in 10 minutes  He goes on too say that he and the streamer he made the post about had both started  twitch together less then a month ago  He also states that him and that guy had gotten together and planned this  Then started to talk about his plan for another  reddit post     At the end he turns off his stream because he thinks he should have 10 thousand followers  and he has to contact  twitch support  All these followers are following  like 1700 people lol   So please be wary of people like this trying to abuse all of our want to grow in streaming    Edit  He has deleted  yesterdays vod  edit 2 he is now messaging me on twitch  telling me that me saying this was shitty and that if twitch doesnt fix this he will be making a new account so whoever called him making a new account got it spot on some people Lol
439,Recently I gifted 5 subs via the new community gift subbing And for those who dont know it randomly gives out subs to viewers  This unfortunately includes bots  you know those really annoying ones twitch hasnt yet removed?  Well as you can see [here]https:iimgurcomJurdoytjpg I found this the hard way Why is this a problem? Well in bigger communities with many viewers the bots are severely outnumbered by honest viewers However in smaller channels such as affiliate channels which is where I was on a stream with ~10 viewers iirc the chance is much greater of giving to a bot  This is problematic in a way Although I am still supporting the streamer which is the partial intention the community isnt able to get the most out of it It takes the community out of community gift subbing  Unfortunately I havent tested blocking these bots and reattempting due to that will be a costly trial and error simulation I advise blocking these bots if you intend to use this gift method in case blocking blacklists them from the random gifting pool   I wonder on your opinions and if youve seen further issues?  I believe there should be a method to exclude certain users especially blocked users from obtaining a randomly gifted sub I do not know if twitch has incorporated this but I honestly hope it is resolved  These bots are becoming more problematic from being gross in the viewers feed to more or less stealing subs not intended for them  Thoughts and suggestions on the matter would be interesting Thanks for the read  Note that I have tweeted to twitch to get no response  Edit: Spelling and grammer 
440,EDIT: ANSWERED GET FrankerFaceZ  Sorry for the title the thread is still the same though  I have as everyone does BTTV and having a huge purple bar on my blackdark gray top page is getting on my nerves its like a neon sign shouting LOOK HERE  I like the rest of the UI change its good UI clean and functional but this bar is legit distracting me to the point of being annoying  Any workaround? some BTTV setting? some Ublock origin script? an exntension? anything?
441,Has anyone ran into this issue that knows how to fix it or am I just out of luck for now?
442,I deleted it and reinstalled it Restarted chrome What could I do to fix it?
443,If youre not promoting it will you still get banned? Just had a stream where I played H1Z1 and people said it multiple times in the proximity voice chat
444,I checked around the sub and didnt quite see my question I promise I looked :  Heres my question elaborated I play League of Legends and sometimes my chat flies by Im the type of person who likes to read chat while I play and having Chat open on another screen kinda slows me down and on a busy night I miss stuff  Im not sure if this is possible but has anyone found a technique to display chat over your gameplay but invisible to OBS? I capture LoL with Game Capture so another window that stays infront would definitely work Id love to have chat on right side of my monitor while I play League   My Issue is that Im not sure if you can keep a chat box Always InFront like OBSs functionality This would also prevent me from looking away for that one second and getting caught off guard while playing FeelsBadMan  Thanks for your time    1Edit:: Answer provided  this program should work OBS ANSWER  https:obsprojectcomforumresourcestwitchstreamerstoolforsinglemonitorstreamers364 Thanks all     2Alternative I think this is better From Baffler: Screenshots in his post below  You can get it here: http:bafflertvHomeTwitchChatOverlay  Let me know if theres any issues or features youd wanna see added Im happy to keep developing it and making it better  Also it requires NET 452 or higher You can download the latest NET framework if you have any issues with it not working  Issue with this one while its on your screen its very easy to accidentally click on it and mess with your gameplay I played League and I had this chat on the right side of my screen I surprisingly click on that side more than I realized so this one does not work for me during LoL For settings info: I play in fullscreen bordeless     3One more alternate ^It ^looks ^pretty ^good ^too  https:restreamiochat  I havent reviewed this one thoroughly myself but I like the look  Final update Thanks all for the support and ideas Ill try a few out and maybe edit the final one that I like and will use  12132017  Still adding updates to the ones Ive tested Recently others have suggested Overwolf havent tested it yet 
445,So I finished my first 24 hour stream yesterday after asking you guys how I should do it I actually managed to do it after listening to all the advice I was given on my last post It ended up being the best stream Ive ever done I reached so many milestones that I thought were so far away  I peaked at 20 viewers I hit 50 followers after gaining 13 in that one stream I got my first host with 11 viewers I received 2 donations I thought that there was no way I would last 24 hours but thanks to Twitch chat being there almost the entire time I never felt bored or tired  
446,Read the entire blog [HERE]https:blogtwitchtvcomingsoonhtml5videoplayerbetacdb94b026a8c9slsxzhe7  Of all the feature requests we receive from the Twitch community HTML5 video easily tops the list and last year at TwitchCon we announced that we were hard at work on a full HTML5 video player We expected to have it available by the second quarter of this year and as you may be able to tell from todays calendar date of June 30th it has taken us a bit longer to build than we expected   The good news is we will start to beta test the full HTML5 video player in July The HTML5 Player Beta will first open to Turbo subscribers Based on the success of this initial test we plan to steadily expand beta access to more users toward the end of the summer
447,everytime i start watching a streamer i get an ad even though i have twitch prime
448,The Xbox One and PS4 Twitch apps need a major overhaul I mostly watch Twitch on my Xbox One and Im also sure that people on PS4 would love an update as well Theres no reason I shouldnt be able to subscribe to a stream from the console apps or cheer bits and other things  So please Address this in some way Please make the console apps the amazing apps that you are capable of making them 
449,Hey all Im a streamer that receives donations through paypal and recently received a large amount of donations ranging from 5 to 300 from a single person over the course of a couple days This person weeks later is now charging back all of these donations and because he immediately escalated it to a case without reaching out to me first or asking for a refund Im now getting hit with 20 charges for EACH and every donation he sent me donations that were unsolicited and that I never even got a chance to refund To make matters worse after speaking to PayPal I was led to believe that I would incur charges only if I chose to dispute the cases which I chose not to do out of fear for the massive fees that would accrue if I lost these cases Now I am in the worst case scenario I didnt even dispute most of the donations and refunded them instead and now Im paying the fees AND not getting to try to dispute the cases If anyone can help Im so scared right now More than an entire months income is hanging in the balance and at the very least I need to reopen the cases or bring some sort of case against the buyer How is it possible that for me even having a link to donate Im going to potentially get charged 800 for somebodys cruel scam when I didnt even contest anything??? Please help I am so lost right now and really scared Thank you Also this was all done through Streamlabs Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide that can help
450,Live stream rewinding Missed a great play or have to go to the restroom? Tough luck There are some workarounds to this feature none of which are convenient     Its been mentioned before but it has to be mentioned again There are gazillion features to take your money would be nice if you would get your moneys worth  By the way the technology is nothing new or rocket science it has been offered by YouTubes service as well by some other independent platforms for some time now
451,This new gift subscription notification text that specifically says the number of gifted subs the person has given in a channel was probably put in place to reward those gifters but its having the opposite effect from my anecdotal experience There are several users who gift a LOT of subs across the community Im in Im talking hundreds a month Each of them has said they give less gift subs because of this new notification which calls out how many theyve done makes them feel awkward etc I could definitely see some people who would like that feature because maybe they like showing off but most people giving gifts are rather humble I dont know if anyone else has seen that in their channels and communities as well Im hoping that Twitch can make that feature optional at a minimum I sent this to twitchs feedback email but that I thought Id share it here as well to hear others feedback and maybe give it some visibility
452,I was born in 1988 and I watched Bob growing up It is so amazing that the new generation get to experience him as well He is such a great role model and the definition of a man I dont think I can thank Twitch enough for this amazing stream I have been on KreyGasm for about 3 days straight now Bob relating painting to his real life adventures with his wife his school teachers and his time in the military is just amazing He is the best father figure I never had I love this man
453,I recall many things are added and need work something about making 3 badges 2728 emotes and even more? not sure what else there is and when it should be finished by before affiliate or shortly after etc 
454,DISCLAIMER Everything written here is based on my own personal preference and style To say that there is one way to grow your Twitch channel would be incorrect My background is in digital marketing and conversion rate optimization Im not a fulltime Twitch streamer Ive watched different streamers of all shapes and sizes critically for a while now and Ive also noticed things that have clearly worked particularly well for me and my own channel growth thus far  For me the name of the game with Twitch Channel Growth is spreading your stream and your past broadcastshighlightsclips to as many other channels across the web as possible WITHOUT spamming That being said lets dive into some Twitch channel growth strategies First and foremost  Contribute to your communities Im part of about 14 Discord servers and I try to chime in and stay active as much as I can I also make a point of checking out the streams and channels of everyone who follows me and expressed interest in my channel I make sure to give advice to new streamers in Discord whenever I can and to help others test their streams This is a two way street guys put in as much as you want to get back  Commit to a schedule obvious Its really hard to grow without this Every article blog and large streamer Ive ever talked to has always said the same thing Committing to a schedule gets your core viewers in a routine and creates regulars to your stream Make sure you have your schedule clearly outlined in your panels below and dont be afraid to end your stream by reminding people what your schedule is and when youre going live next If you miss a day make sure you keep your viewers and your community in the loop by letting them know in advance  Be smart with what you choose to stream If youre streaming super saturated games like PUBG and Fortnite as a new streamer youre going to have a hard time growing Why? Because youre up against hundreds of other channels for views Remember that in Twitchs browse pages streams are categorized by how many views they have at that moment In some cases it would take several minutes for someone to even reach the bottom of the browse page which is where youll be if youre a new streamer with a low view count  Im not suggesting you stop streaming these games altogether especially if you love playing them But if you want channel growth try switching to a game you still enjoy but has less channels fighting for views  A great tool to help you figure out what to stream is Twitch Strike Its an unofficial tool that aggregates Twitch channels and viewer data over time It will give you super valuable insight as to which games have a higher view demand how many channels are currently streaming the game and what percentage of total channels own x of total views As a new streamer looking to grow your channel this data is invaluable  You can also pay to have your stream promoted on their front page when youre live Ive done this for a couple months just to support the developer that built it Surprisingly I consistently got around 8 of my total views from Twitch Strike which is relevant if youre just starting out  YouTube  Social Media Every social media platform provides an opportunity to share your content across the web and to direct people back to your stream Its important to have a dedicated set of social media platforms that you regularly share content on For me its basically just Twitter and Instagram I have a Facebook page as well but I rarely post content on it because I see far more traffic coming to my Twitch stream from Twitter and Instagram  If youre comfortable telling everyone on your personal Facebook page when you go live I say do it Who better to support you and your streaming than friends and family I occasionally do this but not often because I dont want to inundate people on my personal Facebook feed  Also use the Twitch EXPORT TO YOUTUBE feature This is such an easy way to spread highlights and funny moments from your stream to YouTube Dont even worry about having to promote your YouTube channel Just by having your content copied over to YouTube you will become more searchable across the web By doing this you will also make your content more accessible for people who may have seen you passively on Twitch  If you are planning to grow your Twitch channel its important utilize YouTube as Twitch viewers are often on Youtube just as much There is a good reason Twitch makes it so easy for streamers to export their highlights and past broadcasts to YouTube Because it directs YouTube traffic to your Twitch channel  Contests and giveaways are not a mustdo for all streamers especially new ones However they can be a great way to connect with viewers get people excited about your growth and to give back to your community You dont have to spend a bunch of money on fancy prizes either Simple small even handmade prizes often go way further than a gift card  I often do random giveaways for the people in my stream once I hit a high point in views Its also worth mentioning that I rarely advertise giveaways on social media or in my stream titles Its been a great way for me to connect with people make new friends and I also find it really fun I only give away small little things like prints pins action figures video game paraphernalia etc stuff thats easy to mail I love it when people take pictures of what I mailed them and share them online I also ask people to do that if its convenient for them and it also makes it more fun for everyone else who didnt win  Ive got a panel dedicated to Goals  Giveaways where I will award random people in my community once Ive hit specific follower goals I give extra luck to viewers who are in chat more and who are more closely part of my community  You can also rally your viewers and the people in your community to get others involved in giveaways You can also give people extra entries if they for example share your highlights clip your streams or get you a raid There are lots of ways to rally your viewers to help promote your stream via the contests youre running  Gleam is a popular tool for running contests Ive only ever entered contests with it but its a well used and trusted product  There are so many ways of doing contests and giveaways and if you decide to partake you really have to find what works best for you Like most things in life you should also only do contestsgiveaways if you enjoy doing them  Twitter has been a really important part of my Twitch growth up to this point That being said I had a decent amount of followers on Twitter going into it but I dont think thats super relevant as they were mainly digital marketing and music industry connections Consequently I have been slowly building more and more Twitch friends on Twitter and those are the main people that engage with my tweets now  Experiment with different hashtags on Twitter and Instagram for getting your channel and your content out there Do research This is so dependent on the type of streamer you are the content youre making and the type of games your playing Different hashtags are also more relevant depending on the platform Twitter Instagram etc  Ive had some success with SupportSmallStreamers Kappa TwitchFamm TwitchKittens and a few others Growth is all about testing identifying patterns refining and seeing what sticks  Obvious ProTip: Tweet an hour or so before you go live  Think about how you can make your tweets stand out in the vast ocean of noise For example I like to litter my tweets with emojis On average I do get more engagement with tweets I use emojis in Its an easy way to make your tweets stand out  Also use RT twitter accounts sparingly These are Twitter accounts run by bots that just ReTweet tweets that mention them There are so many Find out which ones work best for you and stick with those The ones I use most are @SupStreamers @twitchraid @TwitchSharer @TwitchReTweets @TwitchTVOnline and @Vued_Retweets  Use engagement bots with care Engagement bots are essentially bots that autoengage with content on different social media networks They can do all sorts of different things and they are commonly met with criticism One simple growth hack you can try is to use Tweetfull to like tweets with certain keywords  Perhaps you mainly stream a certain video game You could try having Tweetfull like tweets that often use they keywords from that game Example: if you play a lot of PUBG you might have Tweetfull like tweets that mention chicken dinner PUBG etc  If you had all the time in the world this might be something you would do anyway to meet like minded people in your communities Because we only have so much time in a day it can sometimes be beneficial to use bots like this however ONLY to assist you  WARNING: bot use in social media can get you banned from using entire social media platforms If you try this tactic do your research and due diligence before implementing  Clips  Highlights These are so important for growing your channel Clips are easier to share throughout Twitch but can only be 60 seconds long They are also more for your viewers to use but you can create your own clips from past broadcasts too Clips are also ideal for posting in your Channel Feed Highlights can only be used by streamers and are good for summarizing and capturing funny longer moments of your streams  I like to create my own clips for quick funny moments and shout outs and my own highlights for the purpose of summarizing my streams for new viewers  its about 5050 for me This is totally up to you though and I dont personally have a recommendation for how many clips vs highlights you should make  Highlights should always be exported to your YouTube channel with proper metadata on both platforms  ProTip: after each stream spend 15 minutes clipping andor highlighting the top 23 of moments and then post them to your social media channels  Metadata  Twitch features I talk about metadata and Twitch Features in my article on Channel Presentation Both of these things are KEY to growth and should be taken seriously and always considered The next few paragraphs are pulled right from my article on Twitch Channel Presentation  Most streamers dont realize that they need to go back into their past broadcasts and highlights and add in RELEVANT METADATA like keywords and video descriptions This is important because youre basically telling Twitch what your content is all about making it easier for them to categorize you and feature you in whatever discovery algorithms they have going This is my speculation  Your channels metadata tells Twitch what kind of streamer you are what kind of content you create and how to categorize you It also gets you discovered by new viewers  Tags Dont use tags that are not directly relevant to your streams and your video content This is asking for trouble and will screw you over in the long run A properly tagged highlight or past broadcast will include tags related to the content and keywords that you think people may search for on Twitch Example: if Im streaming Super Mario Maker the tags I might use would be  Super Mario Maker Mario Nintendo Mario Maker etc  Your stream summary and stats give you valuable insights into where your channels traffic is coming from traffic sources when your peak times are for views during your streams what devices people are watching you from which of your videos are getting the more views and much more  One of the most important stats to look at is Avg views Both the Twitch Affiliate and Twitch Partner programmes use this an important criteria for eligibility The name of the game with your Twitch channel stats is seeing patterns in your data so you can optimize where necessary  Eg if most of my views are consistently coming from mobile devices in Wisconsin I want to make sure both my channel and stream are optimized for mobile and my stream schedule is better suited to Wisconsins time zone for my peak viewing times  This is just an example of what I might do based on seeing a consistent pattern in my Twitch channel stats Try not to ignore them  Conclusion What have I missed? Id really love to hear everyones thoughts on this section so please comment below anything you think I may be missing or how your experience has been different  I have a whole series of this stuff on Medium You can find it by just searching JoMo Senpai on Medium There is the intro and Identifying Yourself As a Streamer Community Interaction Equipment Software Tools  Settings Twitch Channel Presentation and Channel Interaction  This work is meant to be updated refined and discussed critically by the Twitch community You can also of course find me on Twitch and Twitter JoMo Senpai everywhere Looking forward to continuing the conversation and talk soon everyone   Edit 1: WOW Thanks for all the great compliments and feedback from everyone I appreciate all the time people have taken into responding   Edit 2: Added a brief DISCLAIMER at the top: To say that there is one way to grow your Twitch channel would be incorrect Its different for everyone and you just have to try a lot of different things and find what works best for you  Edit 3: Updated the section about CONTESTS AND GIVEAWAYS based on all the great feedback from everyone Thanks  Edit 4: Bolded some parts instead of italics  
455,Dear Twitch Staff  Please consider merging the two game sections on Twitch for Age of Empires 2:  [Age of Empires II: The Conquerors]https:wwwtwitchtvdirectorygameAge20of20Empires20II3A20The20Conquerors  [Age of Empires II: HD Edition]https:wwwtwitchtvdirectorygameAge20of20Empires20II3A20HD20Edition  As it stands now most of the biggest AoE2 streamers use the largest channel Age of Empires II: The Conquerors even when they are playing on HD to attract the viewers while new streamers who streams on HD might get overlooked as they might not be aware of this arbitrary split between the games We are a relatively small community and merging the two games would both make navigating easier and potentially attract more viewers to overlooked streams It would be much appreciated if you would look into this issue  Thank you for the consideration and kind regards
456,EDIT5: It seems that Ankhbot staff have addressed this concern I mentioned yesterday they will be updating their EULA and their editor roles in the most recent update Although all this could have been avoided I have respect for these dudes for correcting and addressing out concerns The new EULA and changes to the bot address all the concerns I had for it Thank you guys http:marcinswierzowskicomGalleryProjectsAnkhBotR2Blog   There has been some negative feedback regarding Ankhbots Greetings when their staff come into chats with streamers using their bot Tbh this is a NONISSUE and Ankh is getting too much flak for something so little The real issue that came into view because of this publicity is much more concerning  Here is a screenshot of the EULA in Ankhbot  http:iimgurcomZrLyQwrpng  If a staff member is to act inappropriately or I dont deem his greeting to meet my channels rules I will say that they do meet the channels rules so no harm there then if I ban them then I can no longer use the bot    Okay so if that is the case how does Ankh stop a user from using the bot from doing so?  They do so due to creating a phone home Ankhbot connects to their server receives validation or however you want to describe it and will only connect to Twitch chat if you are not on that banlist This was discovered by blocking all ips except Twitch Ankhheart has since confirmed that they have a banlist and Momo has also confirmed this information See tweet here https:twittercomAnkhHeartstatus836997659512745985 for confirmation on the ban list and phone home   Personally I am against this type of behavior regardless of whether it is allowed or not and that is only an opinion and nothing of real substance  However per the Twitch Dev agreement it is required that if information is obtained from the user then an opt out option must be provided at all times http:iimgurcomaENjZtwpng  https:wwwtwitchtvpdeveloperagreement  If I am wrong about any of this please point out that I am wrong because if I am I will take full responsibility for this misunderstanding  This is the part that is more concerning I hope that Ankh provides an opt out option I understand that the product is free I supported the program since I started streaming over 18 months ago but I will no longer be supporting it due to the above   I will also say that Ankh did request things like this to be emailed to him Honestly though I find it hard to have a group discussion and feel that if he would like to address this issue then he can reply here rather than sending individual emails I also believe in transparency and feel reddit is a good place to have this discussion  EDIT1: I also want to add that this is something we should be questioning about regarding ALL Bots and not just Ankhs I dont have time investigate other bots unfortunately If there are others doing this then it will be nice to know which are doing so   EDIT2: I was also missing the screenshot of the Dev agreement that states the data must be disclosed on what is being obtained Maybe this doesnt apply to Ankh? but it states it in the section in regards to use with Twitch API  EDIT3: I am placing a screencap from Momo confirming they are tracking who is using the bot http:iimgurcomRWlZRwrpng This is tracking data Interpret it in your own way I guess its possible that this could be seen as not tracking data but if so I would like to know how this is not tracking data  
457,Ive tried watching through the ads that show on twitch just to have me reenable my adblocker  Watching the same for 30second unskippable GTA 5 ad for 3 days straightliterally just isnt fun I dont know how Twitch serves its ads but this cant be right Why would i want to see the same uninteresting ad for 3 days straightI even tried clicking on it to see if it went away  Ive seen literally 1 ad through these entire 3 days Someone care to explain how the adsystem is like this? I really see why 99 of twitch users are running adblockers  I wish i could ditch my adblocker if ads arent worse than they are on YouTubeGoogle atleast serves different ads and arent usually 30 second long forced
458,This is a question not a sales ad  Hi  I am a small streamer only 200 followers but Ive got a ton of scenes and its hard to switch between them on my normal keyboard cause I use most those functions in my game eg numpad or function keys or theyre hard to access   The Elgato Streamdeck is SUPER COOL But its like 150 I cant afford that And im not making enough money from streaming anytime soon to justify it   So I built myself this 25 key keypad that uses F1F24 on it And ive mapped them to different scenes in OBS Also turning my cam on and off or muting specific channels    is there anyone else out there who wants something like this?   Heres a pic of it right now: https:iimgurcomiLMwyTejpg  Heres how I use it: https:gfycatcomSinfulThreadbareBellsnake   Im just curious if other people want something like this It certainly feels like it makes my streams better   ~ SpaceWolf  If you have any questions you dont want to ask here please feel free to ask  EDITED to remove discord name and twitter per mods request
459,They have removed the 3dmodeling community wtf? Tags dont even work anymore Artstation community is always empty   Really Twitch? What is that? Are they trying to kill Creative?
460,[Like this gif] http:imgurcomHgBIdwd and [this pic] https:imgurcomaUh95N    HeyGuys ZombiUnicorn here Been running this DSLR setup for about 8 months now and it still looks amazing my camera is fine  no sensor burnout or any issues at all Every day I get messages from streamers asking how I set this up so easily and I will make a video tutorial soon but figured Id share here as welI      I use my Canon t3i with a 30mm Sigma lens I connect it to my PC via mini USB cable not HDMI not through a capture card but directly to the PC I then use a program called SparkoCam to capture the live view SparkoCam has a watermark on the free version but there are multiple license options to choose from and it is sooooo worth it      Since it is only capturing the live view and not recording anything there is no damage to the sensor      Ive run entire 24hour streams with no issues at all You can adjust the settings to the camera within the app but I recommend to go under sources>scroll down and uncheck restart live view every 25 minutes or else your image will lag every restart for a moment      Feel free to ask me any questions below and Ill try my best to answer them
461,A month after I got into streaming I wrote [a howto on growing a stream from small numbers to not as small numbers]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments7hva12practical_specific_and_actionable_ways_for_a_new  I keep sharing that link when people ask as I think its one of the more comprehensive guides thats been written here  I plan to continue that with this piece on networking  Im 3 months into streaming now  I had my best stream without a big host a couple days ago with a 45 average viewers I have a few dozen subs and my numbers are improving every week  I think the continued growth Ive seen is from my networking and group building efforts  Ive started a stream team with Twitch streamers elementfive and lindsywood and well be stumbling our way towards mutual growth for the forseeable future  Everyone is always saying that networking is how you make it on Twitch and most other content creation  They arent very wrong  YouTube might have a very robust discovery technology and organic growth happens very easily there but; On Twitch theyre far too new to have that  Searches are not broad enough theyre not specific enough and theyre not going to point new viewers to your channel  So how do you do it?  What is networking?  In the simplest terms networking is just the sum total of your social interactions with others  In this context social is applied very broadly and loosely  Streamers you talk to people on Twitter that one friends mom on Facebook the sponsor you emailed last month and that person you hosted last week are all people youve networked with  Doing it effectively and usefully takes a lot more than those few errant shots in the dark though  The mechanical bits; Where and What?  How do I network? is the big question new folks ask  How you network is to go looking for people with whom to make connections  Its really that simple  Its been said dozens of times  More specifically though  just go watch streams  Watch people playing the same game you are who have about the same number of viewers  Spend some time with them  Get a feeling for what sort of stream they run  Make sure theyre the type of person you can see yourself being friends with  Keep looking keep poking around  Use discovery tools like Purples Channel Surf or Streamceptioncom if you dont feel like browsing is working for you  Expand your search beyond Twitch; Find people on Twitter using the same hashtags as you are find subReddits for your games join gaming forums email people who seem like they might be the type of person you want to connect with  Dont get too focused on your specific game though  Diversify who you look for  Find people who play similar games reach out to people who clearly know more than you do swallow your pride and ask others to help you out  Hell; Reach for the stars every now and again and contact someone who is far beyond your current skillset and viewership  Many streamers are very generous people who are happy to help someone out if its a reasonable request  So that covers the cold hard emotionless bits that are easier  What is actually important is:  How should I be interacting with these folks?  Be a human being  Be a friend  Humans are primates and primates love helping their friends  The simplest and most effective networking you can do is MAKING FRIENDS  Be who you are and let them be who they are  Listen to these individuals  Seriously listen  Ask about their lives ask about their streaming  Care about the answers  Get to know them how they work how they feel  Forge a bond  My stream team are just people that I felt a connection with and I said Hey why dont we do a voice call some day?  We talked we liked each other and working together just naturally flowed forth from that  A relationship is only as good as the work that both people put into it; You have to be present and you have to keep up with these people  Its just like any other friendship because it IS any other friendship  Some of them will be super close and youll talk about nearly everything others youll just check in with every week or three over the equivalent of digital coffee to catch up and even further there will be some people you touch base with every couple of months because you or they are not the feely type  If youre doing it right these people will not feel like contacts or business associates they will be legit dyedinthewool friends  The sooner you can realize networking is literally just making friends the sooner it will come naturally to you for better or worse yes I realize some people arent great at making friends  If you need help on how to make friends though:  Always offer these new people some value  Some people will call it karma  Thats nonsense voodoo but even in the real world it kind of does work like that  If you are a person who is putting out benefits for other people if you are being nice and if you are being helpful for others  youll generally just attract individuals who are nice helpful and beneficial  Give  Give again  Keep giving  Yes in a practical sense if you keep giving to the same person over and over and over again and they never give back; Stop  They are not your friend and they are just sucking away your energy  Putting out helpful growth valuable information and sharing experiences will make people WANT to be around you  You do not have to be fake to do this and legitimately helping others makes most people feel good  You are building your reputation with every single thing you say and do  The larger your reputation speaks for you being the kind of person other people want to work and play with  the more those people will approach you  From just my couple hours of writing these guides Ive already had many dozen people come by my stream to say thank you  A few of them have stuck around and become friends  If you tell someone you will do something follow through with it  Being reliable and being the person you say you are is important  Be on brand  Your reputation is most of your brand  Its hard to overstate that:  Your brand IS your reputation  Again be honest with people  Be direct  You do not have to be the nicest person ever all of the time and you are allowed to set boundaries  If someone comes to you asking for help that is beyond your capability or even you simply think is a bad idea telling them so in a reasonable and compassionate way is super valuable  Dont berate someone for coming to you; They thought reaching out to you was a good idea  Maybe suggest someone else with better tools or say to them whatever is the truth of the matter  This is not a standard business ladder  This is the worst place to try and Fake it until you make it in several aspects  Dont lie to someone about what you can or cant do to sound important  Do not oversell and underdeliver  Do not pretend  Be honest about where you are and what your intentions and qualifications are  Because some of your friendships will be less hugs and talking about puppies and more about your stream and how you can help each other  I know that I said earlier to take some big chances sometimes  Dont earn a reputation for being a tiny stream that is always asking the big kids for help  Be realistic be patient and realize that you dont have any value to offer someone much much larger than you  If you arent at least  I dont know  A quarter as large as another streamer you probably dont have a lot to give them and run the risk of seeming like a beggar looking for handouts  Unless you know you have skills they need  Know your own skills and capabilites  If you have art skills design skills can coach how to play at pro skill levels or a million other things you can offer that up to someone if you think they need that  Just realize they may disagree with you  Dont take anything personally; Most people are busy living their own lives and they might be rough or rude with you for reasons that have nothing to do with you  You might have mailed them the day their dog died  A few personal notes:   ElementFive told me about a conversation he had with a friend hed been talking to for a while; DrPozLIVE another great chill streamer  The important bit that Poz had to say was something along the lines that the friends you make streaming can often be intense and short term  Like a shooting star  Or if you prefer Robin Williams movie references; Jack  Some of your efforts will yeild AMAZING IMMEDIATE RESULTS which disappear just as quickly  Ive been at this for 3 months and Ive already had that happen a few times  One of them really hurt  My new friend told me to get used to the friendship as they made friends for life  They stopped talking to me weeks ago and never let me know what happened to have things burn out like that  It still bugs me a little  But get used to this and accept it  The more you realize some of these friendships will evaporate faster than real life connections the more youll be prepared for it   Similarly to people disappearing you will sometimes realize that a friend youve made is bad for you bad for your brand or otherwise just a problem for themselves or others  You are in charge of who gets your time and making the hard decision that you cant or shouldnt be working with someone that has turned sour is sometimes the right choice   Keep putting yourself out there  Keep helping other people   As always  if you have any questions concerns or just plain trolling on the matter of networking streaming in general or just want to make a friend please ask in this post DM me or come by my stream  Additionally; our team is small and growing  Were mostly looking outward for people who we want to invite but if youre a growth driven individual that feels like youre learning and growing on your own but think your insight would be even better as part of a team please say hi
462,Ive been subbed to this one person for about a year but sometimes they take breaks and dont stream for a while At one time they were gone for a good 45 months I kept my sub but now they are MIA again and I had to unsub: Anyone else do the same?
463,Many ppl have complained that clips on phone keep buffering and clips are automatically muted when opened mirror clips work just fine
464,Im just writing this up as a way to vent some frustrations  A year and a half ago I started streaming through the Xbox Twitch app I really enjoyed it About 4 months later I decided to build a PC for gaming and streaming My laptop had just died so I needed some sort of computer anyhow I never built the PC expecting to make the money back from streaming because I knew the odds of it were slim to none I built it knowing I was probably never going to see that 1200 again which I was ok with because like I said I needed a computer anyhow  I should also mention that a month before building my PC I had just bought my first home as well This comes into play later  Built the PC and started streaming Growth was slow Like really slow It took me another 4 months to gain 20 followers On top of that people just simply werent coming to my channel even though I would get the word out as best as possible about it through Instagram Facebook Twitter etc I know its not a guarantee to have people to always check out your stream and I also know its dependent on what games you stream Ive played many many different games with great communities and still found very little growth and quite frankly viewers coming into my channel   You can say Im focusing too much on viewers but I enjoy entertaining people and dont see viewers as a number to make me more known Its fucking hard to stay positive when doing this 5 days a week when it feels like nobody drops by   But then I realized that my hours are preventing me from having people come to my stream I work my day job from 9:30am until 6:00pm I get off work and stream for an hour or two before I have to stop to spend time with my family because the last thing I want to do is lose my family over something like streaming An hour or two is not much   I then decided to get up at 6am and stream for 2 hours before going to work hoping that I would have a better outreach to an audience It didnt work I literally spent all of my free time streaming with almost no results And on top of my entire free time being consumed by streaming I still have my house that I just bought to look after That takes up even more time  What it boils down to is that I just simply dont have the time to stream like I thought I would Its frustrating because like I said I love entertaining people but I just dont even have the time to draw people into my channel to even entertain them You know what I mean?  You can go back through my old Vods and criticize me saying Im boring and dont talk enough but I have only gotten into this trend over the last month or two because Ive lost all motivation to stream  Im trying to be positive about streaming but I think I need a long break from it Ive learned a lot from this sub and the community here You guys are great and I appreciate all of the answers Ive recieved for questions I asked when I was new to streaming   Thank you guys  Edit: thanks for all the responses I made this post to vent and got some good insight from people Long story short I think Im going to stay on Twitch stream less frequently and stream stuff other than games such as IRL to keep my sanity
465,So about a month ago someone hacked into my account and changed my username I had two factor authentication enabled and never even received an email that my name was changed I logged into my account the next day and my name was different  Ive tried emailing twitch numerous times and even tweeted at twitch support and Ive heard nothing back   Is there any other way to get a hold of them to get my name back? I know I can wait 60 days and change my name but Id really just like my original name back which wont be available again for 6 months  Thanks for the help

468,Hey there folks  Good to see you all again and thanks for reading the post  Today I will be talking about the big dark mass that looms over most if not all smaller streamers on Twitch as a platform Yep thats right its oversaturation of certain categories    Its no secret that Twitch has seen exponential growth over the past few years with as of February over 27000 partners and 150000 affiliates [source]https:techcrunchcom20180206twitchnowhas27kpartnersand150kaffiliatesmakingmoneyfromtheirvideos Which I am sure has grown massively since   x200B;  What is Saturation?  Saturation is something that will inevitably affect every single Twitch streamer at some point yes even the big guys It happens when a category on Twitch or a game has a tonne of hype around it causing 10s or maybe even 100s of thousands of streamers to stream in said category This in turn creates many many pages of Twitch streamers much like yourself attempting to be discovered and because said category is so full this makes growth for the little guys much harder    Unfortunately there is no way to avoid this saturation at this point in time Its simply not avoidable when you want to play the biggest and hottest games on Twitch An example of this may be Red Dead Redemption 2 which Im sure most people have seen at the top of the browse page over the past few days since its initial release With pages and pages of mid to high range streamers flooding this category if a smaller guy were to stream on this category they may see no growth to their channel or even at times loss    Of course there are our knights in shining armour who scroll for pages and pages to find the little guy really kicking but with their streams but these are far and in between  x200B;  Who does this affect?  Mostly youll find this affecting the small to midrange variety streamers who choose to play the largest games on Twitch Although we also see this affecting those playing games like Fortnite which lurk around the top of the browse page most of the time Playing these hugely popular games is a proven tough path for those getting started if they wish to progress and grow at a rate they are happy with   x200B;  What are Twitch doing to help?  A few days ago as you folks may have seen we saw the start of TwitchCon 2018 which in itself appeared oversaturated During this event Twitch Developers presented a Twitch Keynote which highlighted some of the huge things coming in the near future to Twitch although in this post I will only be covering one of them In the near future in the post they advise later this year Twitch will be bringing us a feature that has been long awaited which will hopefully help viewers discover new streamers Although they have advised that they will be rolling out multiple featured sections on the Twitch homepage the most interesting one to me is the up and coming streamers section    Although we dont know much information yet we may well see this being the start of the end for oversaturation and the start of brand new Twitch Streamers growing with the platform as they set off in their journey Im very excited to see what the new featured sections will being but I have a feeling its gonna be HUGE  x200B;  Let me know your thoughts on this Id love to discuss Read the keynote [here]https:blogtwitchtvtwitchcon2018keynote56be103fea21  x200B;  Cheers

472,Watching twitchpresents which is doing Amazon pilots atm   It imo be cool to have a channel thats for twitch prime that airs shows like regular tv   I really like how we can chat while watching and would like for something like this be a permanent feature  
473,Hey guys  Weve started the rollout of the new video player to 2 of users Well be bumping up that number to 100 after we fix any remaining bugs [Heres a screenshot]http:iimgurcom8d5MxR1png  This player still uses Flash to display video but the entire player interface has been ported to HTMLJS This puts us one step closer to killing Flash entirely and youll hear more from us about that in the coming weeks Aside from the swanky new UI weve also improved the native HLS fallback player available on Safari and Microsoft Edge when Flash is unavailable   If youre not one of the 2 you can still demo the new player via the popoutembed player Visit this url and change the parameter to your favorite channel: http:playertwitchtv?channel=monstercat   Let us know if you guys run into bugs or have any suggestions
474,To start off let us just acknowledge I am neither a Twith Partner or Affiliate but generally a viewer  I can see both sides of the argument revolving around sub buttons for twitch affiliates I understand that yes by affiliates having a sub button the separation from partner to affiliate is now minimal when it comes to functionality and I can sympathize  You put in a lot of work you got to partner and now a bunch of people below your level are getting most of the same benefits as you  Seems unfair right?  Well not exactly  Let us consider a few things  EDIT:  The difference between Partner and Affiliate I should not say is minimal but yes the gap has closed a little  But clearly not even as much as I had thought as I am not fully knowledgeable about what all benefits are received from either party  However that only strengthens my argument :  DJTruthsayer is a partner that put it best by saying the biggest downfall to affiliate sub buttons is that he wont be able to afford to sub to all the affiliates he wants to support  That is the true attitude of a quality twitch partner who recognizes that the community is important  I know many of you partners are happy for the affiliates and to you guys my hat goes off to you and this is not directed towards you as I am sure you know     Anyway to my primary points:   In the business world you will always get competition  What does that mean?  You simply need to keep up your game and the quality of your content etc  You arent going to lose subs to the affiliates unless the affiliates are actually better than you  So if you are afraid that affiliate subs is going to HURT your brand then maybe thats because you need to actually improve your own content  Affiliates arent going to steal your subs or viewers  If they were going to theyd have your viewers already   Secondly affiliates getting sub buttons is an opportunity for ALL of twitch to grow  Twitch is a growing entity and many people want to support the people they watch but are limited in their ways to do so simply because their favorite streamer isnt partnered yet  These people dont come running up to partners to throw away money because they cant sub to their affiliate streamer  So again you arent losing people but giving more viewers a desire to stay and support their favorite content creators which in turn causes twitch to grow Another point is that most of the largest partners out there had it a lot easier than new streamers joining in  Partner requirements have only gotten harder as twitch has grown because they dont want to over saturate the market  It could be argued that it is actually harder for a streamer today to make partner than it was a few years ago so saying that you worked so hard to earn your partner and now some smaller streamers are going to get YOUR perks is ridiculous because MOST smaller streamers that would actually receive subs work just as hard as you do if not harder  I know MANY affiliate streamers who put out high quality content and bust their backs trying to grow their communities on twitch and who easily have the numbers to have made partner a couple years ago but cant break through now     The fact as as industries grow more people come into it which in turn changes the dynamic  Twitch recognizes that it needs to help the smaller streamers who are more easily lost in the sea of the streaming world today grow because that is the ONLY way for Twitch itself to continue to grow  Furthermore competitive markets in other streaming sites with benefits for all streamers of all sizes means twitch also needs to keep up with changing demands in the industry     So while I understand where your frustration may come from you all need to remember where you came from how you started and how it felt when you never imagined making partner  Everyone has been there and the affiliates of today are working every bit as hard as you and frankly in my opinion probably even harder  You were first and yes you grew the industry but thats what pioneering anything does  The first people to do anything always pave the way for those who follow and things change  I bowled in college and there were almost no scholarship opportunities to do so as most schools had it as a club sport and we had to fundraise for all of our expenses on our own time  But due to my generations growing of the sport colleges all across the US now offer scholarship opportunities for the sport as well as actually fund their teams  Thats how life works so sorry partners but in the end you need to get off your high horse and realize thats how things work  At least you can continue doing what you do and still benefit     Pioneers pave the way for those to follow in their footsteps and Twitch partners are just starting to learn this  While growing the industry things are going to change and many opportunities will arise for the newcomers that you didnt have but it is not in spite of you but rather BECAUSE of you 
475,Its a honest question We know G2A is the number one questionable key site on the net and yet half of the streams are plagued with its support  Example:  http:iimgurcomlK2HNFbjpg  
476,I ran some reruns last night for the first time and noticed a few people come induring the few hours they were running attempting to chat I leave chat open all the time but only check it once every few hours when im not streaming a few people were trying to communicate with me not understanding that the stream was a rerun has anybody figured out a solution to this? I stream every other day and would like to run reruns on my off days but dont want to turn people away since i wouldnt be responding to their chat follow alerts and such
477,Idk if it was twitch that did it before or BTTV tbh but it was so useful Please just integrate it into the new twitch Like you can type the emote channelsubhype and hit tab and it would be channelSubHYPE  as an example or even channelsu and hit tab and it would auto complete it with correct capitalization 
478,I have been playing Thief Simulator since it came out and have been seeing a lot of growth in my channel I went from a channel that has 46 viewers to 1820 viewers and actually gained about 20 followers over the course of 3 weeks playing it I have completed the game in normal mode and hard mode kicking ass on the way to finishing the game Now my dilemma is do I keep playing this game for growth or do I switch game? If so how do you switch game while retaining some of the viewers? Should I just continue Thief Simulator and gain a cult following before switching?  x200B;  Some good suggestions in the discussion below For the benefit of the first time reader of the post or anybody who searches for the same topic I have summarized what was suggested so far but still open to further addition:  1 Try to do speed run on the game 2 Introduce self assigned challenge playing the game  to increase longevity and replayability of the game   3 Try to ask the viewers what games we should play next 4 Try to ease the new game to the viewers while still playing the original game that brings you growth 5 Play a game of the same genre if possible and game that you enjoy 6 Definitely dont stay with the same game if there is no longevity 7 Introduce a Theme stream for different days: eg Multiplayer Mondays New game Wednesday Solo Satrudays etc
479,I just wanted to wish everyone a happy mothers day today and applaud all of your hard work I hope today turns out wonderful for all of you
480,I understand that integrating bits into mobile may have its challenges and need a slight up charge but the difference between the two is too high  Look at the prices of bits around 50005500 bits for example  https:imgurcoma6efRuyp
481,TL;DR  So before I start I wish to apologize for I am not English but I try my best  About 5 weeks ago I made a 25000 bit purchase to support a streamer but due to some technical issue the transaction went through twice Now instead of paying 32014 372641 i lost 64028 74531 I got 50000 bits but this was unwanted My brother shares his Visa card with me and this transaction now took a heavy toll on the both of us because he happened to get some bills he needs to pay as well I can understand that technical issues happen and are not anyones fault But I am here to complain about the support twitch has given me on this issue   nbsp;  According to my bank I should first reach out to the support to handle this issue before disputing it And I have tried my best to work with these guys but without any result except frustration I will explain everything I went through to get where I am now:  The streamer I donated to decided to help me with this she contacted twitch through twitter where they told her Id best make a ticket on twitch for this I did as told made a ticket and waited 8 days before making another ticket I got a reply after roughly 2 weeks The reply said:  nbsp;  Hello  Our sincerest apologies for the delay in response our team has been quite active lately helping the community with all the exciting updates to the site  For any assistance regarding Bits charges please direct your inquiries to Amazon directly You may use this page to locate all the contact info for Amazon  Thanks   nbsp;  So we went to Amazon to get this mistake fixed But unlike twitch Amazon actually replied within 20 hours Outstanding support if I do say so myself but the reply was not what I expected:  nbsp;  Hello  Im sorry for the inconvenience caused  I understand you want a refund for Twitch Bits order that was accidentally purchased  Although Twitch Interactive is part of the Amazon family it is independently operated Please contact Twitch Interactive directly at purchasesupport@twitchtv for help with refund for the Twitch Bits order  We look forward to seeing you again soon  nbsp;  So Amazon tells me this is Twitchs domain That only leaves me to wonder why they would redirect me to Amazon Bad support? Incompetence? Refusing to give the money back? I can only guess Anyway i was very frustrated at this point and  I send a mail to twitch on the given email to get this over with 9 days later I get a reply back saying:  nbsp;  Thanks for contacting Twitch support Our sincerest apologies for the delay in response our team has been quite active lately helping the community with all the exciting updates to the site In the chance that your issue has resolved itself since contacting us then that is great news If not and you would still like some assistance please reply back to this and a representative will contact you shortly  Note the part The chance that your issue has resolved itself I do not see how this issue can resolve itself instead of someone actually looking into this matter they just send me one of these standard prewritten email without a second thought about this matter At this point i was VERY frustrated and Ive written a pretty angry mail back and telling them that maybe Ill have to go public with this issue After that mail I got a mail back the same day I was literally thrilled and excited by this The reply I got was:  nbsp;  Of course so sorry about this Our apologies at this time Please provide me with the Order numbers from your email receipts for both of the related payments so that I may issue this for you Thanks  nbsp;  This was progress for me I was happy Until 7 days later where I still had no reply of any kind No feedback or nothing At this point the Visa got cleared so we knew the Visa was going to charge the bank soon We have near nothing left at this point and I send my last mail to twitch 2 days ago I explained them that Im going further with this im going public and Im going to my bank again for a dispute  And i do not care how far I will have to push this This kind of support is unacceptable for a company as large as twitch  What does it take for twitch to cooperate with me? how much more time and effort will I have to put into this? Is twitch refusing to refund? this amount is NOTHING to them but LIFE CHANGING to us at this current time Maybe they arent refusing maybe their employees lack the capability of doing their job properly Or maybe they have to put their entire staff on these so called exciting updates to the site so that they cannot help me  nbsp;  I do not know what twitchs issue is with helping me with my issue but it has frustrated me very much and I just want it to stop I have unsubbed to all the streamers i was subbed to I stopped purchasing bits I WILL NOT support twitch before this issue is fixed   Im running out of options here and if the issue isnt resolved with Twitch directly Ill be forced to go to my bank and dispute the double purchase Im open to hearing any advice or solution anyone can offer for me regarding my issue  nbsp;  nbsp;  EDIT:  nbsp;  So i got a reply here from nerolabs Many thanks My case got noticed and something is being done about it hopefully this will will avoid further complications for other people in the future  I got confirmation via email:  nbsp;  So sorry about this In an effort to rectify this situation with you our valued user we have refunded 61600 308  2 back to you please allow up to 23 business days for this to post to your account Please do not hesitate to reach out should you experience any troubles Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused Have a GREAT day and please ENJOY the streams \^o^ Kindest Regards Twitch Support  nbsp;  Aside from this email I got confirmation from Amazon as well that both transactions have been refunded This is going to help us out a lot many thanks Despite the long wait twitch support did seem willing to resolve this issue I do not know where this went wrong or what happened exactly but hopefully this will avoid other people from running in the same issue and hopefully twitch support will pay more attention  To me this seems like a good sign that I can trust twitch and that they are willing to help people with their issues It was also nice to see theres so many understanding people and people willing to give me options for the worst case scenarios Thank you everyone who contributed  I will update this post once more after we receive the refunded amount back in a few days Thank you
482,Unbelievable to say the least 
483,So Basically if you dont want to listen to the songs you are playing on your streams maybe because you are in a competitive game where you need to hear footsteps around you this can help you It will play the music for your streams but you wont listen to it Heres a tutorial= https:wwwyoutubecomwatch?v=l7xysWJ7mjQ
484,Theres a very troublesome and consistent problem among Twitch streaming communities And this post is basically a plea to the streamers to do something about what they indeed have control over  The problem Im referring to has to do with regulars of a stream Countless times I will join a new stream in hopes to find friendly communities but almost every time there is that at least one user that says the most ignorant things reacts in the most immature manner andor is flat out rude  and the majority of the time the user is what the stream and their community considers a regular  Ive dealt with this many times but the final straw was just earlier this week when a regular gave me a completely unwarranted and unexpected reply consisting of kys acronym for kill yourself When I asked was that directed at me the user said it was When I asked why and for what purpose they said they didnt know and continued to accent their comments with lols or rofls And again I wish I could say this was the first time experiencing something like this but its an unfortunate pattern that drives me away from what otherwise I think would be a great community  I would also suggest that if youre in my situation and a regular has discouraged you from staying with the community to let the streamer know this No drama is necessary no hateful messages are needed A simple message stating that you dont appreciate being treated the way you are by X user is why youre not sticking around Or you could even send them a message offstream via some other social network  Streamers: Find some courage Have the strength to call out a regular on their BS It doesnt matter if they were follower number one  nothing should give a person the privilege that allows them to be negative and hurtful to other new users in the chat Will it be a little awkward? Possibly But in the end such as in my case youre losing future viewers because you dont have the guts to call out a regular acting like a jerk even though that fake laugh you give and awkward body language you show clearly indicates youre not comfortable with how the user is acting either Do something Say something Let them know that whether youre follower number one or follower number one thousand everyone in your community should be treated as equal in the sense of respect and tolerance  TL;DR: Streamers grow a spine and call out your regulars who act like assholes to everyone Its not helping you or helping you grow your community and also causing you to miss out on other potential followers who would like to contribute some sort of positivity and communication in your stream
485,I only have 18 followers so Im practically nonexistent on the Twitch universe However out of these 18 and for the last year I have one viewer who almost always watches Hes talkative in the chat helps me in games when I ask joins in sometimes and is all round a really nice person Ive always appreciated him and even if I stream for hours and get no other viewers I can still rely on him to make it worth my time   So tonight while I was streaming the topic of childhood games came up and I mentioned I had an urge to replay Sonic itd been on my steam wish list for a while now and I was waiting for it to drop in price to buy it He only went in my steam wish list and gifted it He said I didnt know how else to support you so I gifted you a game   I know a lot of you get frequent donationsgifted games so it might not seem like such a huge deal but it made me feel so chuffed today Its just the idea that a stranger out there likes watching me play games and talk nonsense for hours on end enough to spend their money on me  The game is like 15 so by no means cheap and it meant even more to me because I know hes a university student made me feel kinda guilty tbh  I feel lucky and appreciative when people simply watch so getting that game was such a lovely surprise   Just goes to show too its not all about the numbers I have such few followers and viewers but the ones who do talk and support me are more than enough to make streaming fun for me 
486,Hello everyone A few months back I put together a fairly lengthy guide to broadcasting The original post was well received but the guide was limited in its initially released form as a basic PDF hosted on dropbox Ive taken the time to update the guide with a major overhaul recreating as a much more functional webpage as well as some minor editing changes [You can view the updated guide here]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtml  As I pointed out when I first put this guide out it is lengthy and definitely not meant to be read straight through from beginning to end There are a lot of covered topics and they are intended to be tackled as you need them Also many of them are geared towards broadcasters first starting out with Twitch Feel free to share the guide in its complete form and I would appreciate any suggestions you might offer in the comments for revisions in an updated release Ive included links to the major topics the guide covers below You can also navigate the guide itself fairly easily using the arrow keys or the inguide table of contents  Web design html and js arent my forte so the current release of the guide is somewhat limited This version is not mobilefriendly and lacks a few quality of life features that I hope to add in the future I expect upcoming versions to have updates on basic functionality content revisions and links to additional indepth resources on individual topics If you want to look at the original version of this guide you can find it through [this subreddit post]https:wwwredditcomrTwitchcomments4eyva6a_guide_to_streaming_and_finding_success_on_twitch I hope to archive previous versions of the guide itself in the future for easy access  nbsp;  nbsp;  [Table of Contents]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlcontents   [Title]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmltitle  [Disclaimer]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmldisclaimer  [Introduction]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlintroduction  [Thanks]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlthanks  nbsp;  [Part I]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlpart1   [Starting Out]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlstartingout  [What Are Your Goals?]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlgoals  [Equipment and Software]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlequipmentandsoftware  [Equipment]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlequipment  [Software]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlsoftware  [Early Growth]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlearlygrowth  [Positive Streaming Behaviors]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlpositivebehaviors  nbsp;   [Part II]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlpart2   [Networking]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlnetworking  [Social Media]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlsocialmedia  [Growth From Game Choice]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlgamechoice  [Community and Moderation]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlcommunityandmoderation  [Branding]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlbranding  [Suggestions by Size]http:wwwoverboredgamingcomguidehtmlsuggestions
487,Have something negative to say? Keep it constructive and proactive in nature  Im going to be working hard to avoid tripping the sensors on that one   I think its time we had a discussion about some of the female streamers who are using their assets to solicit donations from a specific younger male audience  Note: This isnt about gender shaming There are tons of incredibly skilled and dedicated female streamers who focus on gaming and deserve viewers more than these cam girls    I honestly believe that Twitch enforcing their own rules about sexually suggestive content would be a huge benefit to the community as a whole   Less cam shows and more legitimate gamingfocused streams will result in more ad revenue and donations for legitimate streamers allowing for higher quality production values more benefits for subscribers giveaways and in some cases actually allowing real gaming streamers to give up the day job and focus on streaming full time a pipe dream that many of us Twitch viewersstreamers share  These cam show streams could also have a hugely negative impact on the perceived legitimacy of female gamers  it encourages the fucking stupid opinion that women cant compete with male gamers streams and need to show boob to get subs  Finally I know the problem doesnt just rest with the cam girl streamers themselves but also with the prepubescent teens that legitimize their actions with donations and Twitch for not enforcing their own rules   Twitch has created an environment where it pays to be sexually suggestive one prominent cam girl has even unashamedly boasted about this on live stream chat with Twitch admins present on a site that isnt age gated to prevent hormonal youngsters from being suckered in by their actions With more and more brands sponsoring streamers this could also lead to companies using these cam girls to have their products endorsed to a younger male audience via streams  Im interested in hearing other peoples thoughts on the subject so we can have a nice open discussion Im not interested in listening to rants or witchhunts about specific streamers
